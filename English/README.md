## 1.0 Expressions, Equations, and Functions

<article>

The study of expressions, equations, and functions is the basis of mathematics. Each mathematical subject requires knowledge of manipulating equations to solve for a variable. Careers such as automobile accident investigators, quality control engineers, and insurance originators use equations to determine the value of variables.

![0](media/1.png "Figure 1: Functions are methods of explaining relationships and can be represented as a rule, a graph, a table, or in words. The amount of money in a savings account, how many miles run in a year, or the number of trout in a pond are all described using functions.")

Throughout this chapter, you will learn how to choose the best variables to describe a situation, simplify an expression using the Order of Operations, describe functions in various ways, write equations, and solve problems using a systematic approach.

### 1.1 Variable Expressions

<article>

Who Speaks Math, Anyway?
------------------------

When someone is having trouble with algebra, they may say, “I don’t speak math!” While this may seem weird to you, it is a valid statement. Math, like English, French, Spanish, or Arabic, is a secondary language that you must learn in order to be successful. There are verbs and nouns in math, just like in any other language. In order to understand math, you must practice the language.

A verb is a “doing” word, such as run, jump, or drive. Mathematics verbs are also “doing” words. A math verb is called an **operation.** Operations can be something you have used before, such as addition, multiplication, subtraction, or division. They can also be more complex, like an exponent or square root.

**Example:** Suppose you have a job earning $8.15 per hour. What could you use to quickly find out how much money you would earn for different hours of work?

**Solution:** You could make a list of all the possible hours, but that would take forever! So instead, you let the “hours you work” be replaced with a symbol, like $h$ for hours, and write an equation such as:

$$
amount \ of \ money = 8.15(h)
$$

A noun is usually described as a person, place, or thing. In mathematics, nouns are called numbers and **variables.** A variable is a symbol, usually an English letter, written to replace an unknown or changing quantity.

![0](media/2.png "Figure 1: **Example:** What variables would be choices for the following situations?")

a. the number of cars on a road

b. time in minutes of a ball bounce

c. distance from an object

**Solution:** There are many options, but here are a few to think about.

a. Cars is the changing value, so $c$ is a good choice.

b. Time is the changing value, so $t$ is a good choice.

c. Distance is the varying quantity, so $d$ is a good choice.

Why Do They Do That?
--------------------

Just like in the English language, mathematics uses several words to describe one thing. For example, _sum, addition, more than,_ and _plus_ all mean to add numbers together. The following definition shows an example of this.

**Definition:** To **evaluate** means to follow the verbs in the math sentence. **Evaluate** can also be called simplify or answer.

To begin to evaluate a mathematical **expression**, you must first **substitute** a number for the variable.

**Definition:** To **substitute** means to replace the variable in the sentence with a value.

Now try out your new vocabulary.

**Example:** EVALUATE $7y-11$, when $y = 4$.

**Solution:** Evaluate means to follow the directions, which is to take 7 times $y$ and subtract 11. Because $y$ is the number 4,

$$
\begin{align*}
&7 \times 4 - 11 && \text{We have ``substituted'' the number 4 for}\ y.\\
&28 - 11 && \text{Multiplying}\ 7 \ \text{and}\ 4\\
&17 && \text{Subtracting}\ 11 \ \text{from}\ 28\\
&\text{The solution is}\ 17.
\end{align*}
$$

Because algebra uses variables to represent the unknown quantities, the multiplication symbol $\times$ is often confused with the variable $x$. To help avoid confusion, mathematicians replace the multiplication symbol with parentheses ( ), the multiplication dot $\cdot$, or by writing the expressions side by side.

**Example:** Rewrite $P = 2 \times l + 2 \times w$ with alternative multiplication symbols.

**Solution:** $P = 2 \times l + 2 \times w$ can be written as $P = 2 \cdot l + 2 \cdot w$

It can also be written as $P = 2l + 2w$.

The following is a real-life example that shows the importance of evaluating a mathematical variable.

**Example:** To prevent major accidents or injuries, these horses must be fenced in a rectangular pasture. If the dimensions of the pasture are 300 feet by 225 feet, how much fencing should the ranch hand purchase to enclose the pasture?

**Solution:** Begin by drawing a diagram of the pasture and labeling what you know.

![0](media/3.png "Figure 2: To find the amount of fencing needed, you must add all the sides together;")

$$
L + L + W + W.
$$

By substituting the dimensions of the pasture for the variables $L$ and $W$, the expression becomes

$$
300 + 300 + 225 + 225.
$$

Now we must evaluate by adding the values together. The ranch hand must purchase 1,050 feet of fencing.

### 1.2 Order of Operations

<article>

The Mystery of Math Verbs
-------------------------

Some math verbs are “stronger” than others and must be done first. This method is known as the **Order of Operations.**

A mnemonic (a saying that helps you remember something difficult) for the **Order of Operations** is PEMDAS - Please Excuse My Daring Aunt Sophie.

The Order of Operations:

Whatever is found inside **PARENTHESES** must be done first. **EXPONENTS** are to be simplified next. **MULTIPLICATION** and **DIVISION** are equally important and must be performed moving left to right. **ADDITION** and **SUBTRACTION** are also equally important and must be performed moving left to right.

**Example 1:** Use the Order of Operations to simplify $(7-2) \times 4 \div 2-3$

**Solution:** First, we check for parentheses. Yes, there they are and must be done first.

$$
(7 - 2) \times 4 \div 2 - 3 = (5) \times 4 \div 2 - 3
$$

Next we look for exponents (little numbers written a little above the others). No, there are no exponents so we skip to the next math verb.

Multiplication and division are equally important and must be done from left to right.

$$
\begin{align*}
5 \times 4 \div 2 - 3 & = 20 \div 2 - 3\\
20 \div 2 - 3 & = 10 - 3
\end{align*}
$$

Finally, addition and subtraction are equally important and must be done from left to right.

$10-3 = 7$ This is our answer.

**Example 2:** Use the Order of Operations to simplify the following expressions.

a) $3 \times 5-7 \div 2$

b) $3 \times (5 - 7) \div 2$

c) $(3 \times 5) - (7 \div 2)$

**Solutions:**

a) There are no parentheses and no exponents. Go directly to multiplication and division from left to right: $3 \times 5 - 7 \div 2 = 15 - 7 \div 2 = 15 - 3.5$

Now subtract: $15 - 3.5 = 11.5$

b) Parentheses must be done first: $3 \times (-2) \div 2$

There are no exponents, so multiplication and division come next and are done left to right: $3 \times (-2) \div 2 = -6 \div 2 = -3$

c) Parentheses must be done first: $(3 \times 5) - (7 \div 2) = 15 - 3.5$

There are no exponents, multiplication, division, or addition, so simplify:

$$
15 - 3.5 = 11.5
$$

Parentheses are used two ways. The first is to alter the Order of Operations in a given expression, such as example (b). The second way is to clarify an expression, making it easier to understand.

Some expressions contain no parentheses while others contain several sets of parentheses. Some expressions even have parentheses inside parentheses! When faced with **nested parentheses**, start at the innermost parentheses and work outward.

**Example 3:** Use the Order of Operations to simplify $8-[19-(2+5)-7]$

**Solution:** Begin with the innermost parentheses:

$$
8-[19-(2+5)-7]=8-[19-7-7]
$$

Simplify according to the Order of Operations:

$$
8-[19-7-7]=8-[5]=3
$$

Evaluating Algebraic Expressions with Fraction Bars
---------------------------------------------------

Fraction bars count as grouping symbols for PEMDAS, and should be treated as a set of parentheses. All numerators and all denominators can be treated as if they have invisible parentheses. When **real** parentheses are also present, remember that the innermost grouping symbols should be evaluated first. If, for example, parentheses appear on a numerator, they would take precedence over the fraction bar. If the parentheses appear outside of the fraction, then the fraction bar takes precedence.

**Example 4:** Use the Order of Operations to simplify the following expressions.

a) $\frac{z + 3}{4} - 1$ _when_ $z = 2$

b) $\left (\frac{a+2}{b+4} - 1 \right ) + b$ _when_ $a = 3$ and $b = 1$

c) $2 \times \left ( \frac{w + (x - 2z)}{(y + 2)^2} - 1 \right )$ _when_ $w = 11, \ x = 3, \ y = 1$ and $z = -2$

**Solutions:** Begin each expression by substituting the appropriate value for the variable:

a) $\frac{(2+3)}{4} -1 = \frac{5}{4} -1$. Rewriting 1 as a fraction, the expression becomes:

$$
\frac{5}{4} - \frac{4}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
$$

b) $\frac{(3+2)}{(1+4)} = \frac{5}{5} = 1$

$(1 - 1) + b$ Substituting 1 for _b,_ the expression becomes $0 + 1 = 1$

c) $2 \left ( \frac{[11+(3-2(-2))]}{[(1+2)^2)]} - 1 \right ) = 2 \left ( \frac{(11+7)}{3^2}  -1 \right ) = 2 \left (\frac{18}{9} - 1 \right )$

Continue simplifying: $2\left ( \frac{18}{9} - \frac{9}{9} \right ) = 2 \left ( \frac{9}{9} \right ) = 2(1)= 2$

Using a Calculator to Evaluate Algebraic Expressions
----------------------------------------------------

A calculator, especially a graphing calculator, is a very useful tool in evaluating algebraic expressions. The graphing calculator follows the Order of Operations, PEMDAS. In this section, we will explain two ways of evaluating expressions with the graphing calculator.

**Method #1:** This method is the direct input method. After substituting all values for the variables, you type in the expression, symbol for symbol, into your calculator.

_Evaluate_ $[3(x^2 - 1)^2 - x^4 + 12] + 5x^3 - 1$ _when_ $x = -3$.

![0](media/6.png "Figure 1: _Substitute the value_ $x = -3$ _into the expression._")

$$
[3((-3)^2 -1)^2 - (-3)^4 + 12] + 5(-3)^3 - 1
$$

The potential error here is that you may forget a sign or a set of parentheses, especially if the expression is long or complicated. Make sure you check your input before writing your answer. An alternative is to type the expression in by appropriate chunks – do one set of parentheses, then another, and so on.

**Method #2:** This method uses the STORE function of the Texas Instrument graphing calculators, such as the TI-83, TI-84, or TI-84 Plus.

_First, store the value $x = -3$ in the calculator. Type_ -3 **\[STO\]** $x$. (_The letter $x$ can be entered using the_ $x$\-**\[VAR\]** _button or_ **\[ALPHA\] + \[STO\]**). _Then type in the expression in the calculator and press_ **\[ENTER\]**.

![0](media/7.png "Figure 2: _The answer is_ $-13.$")

Note: On graphing calculators there is a difference between the minus sign and the negative sign. When we stored the value negative three, we needed to use the negative sign, which is to the left of the **\[ENTER\]** button on the calculator. On the other hand, to perform the subtraction operation in the expression we used the minus sign. The minus sign is right above the plus sign on the right.

You can also use a graphing calculator to evaluate expressions with more than one variable.

_Evaluate the expression:_ $\frac{3x^2 - 4y^2 + x^4}{(x + y)^{\frac{1}{2}}}$ _for_ $x = -2, y = 1$.

![0](media/8.png "Figure 3: Store the values of $x$ and $y$. $-2$ **\[STO\]** $x$, 1 **\[STO\]** $y$. The letters $x$ and $y$ can be entered using **\[ALPHA\] + \[KEY\]**. Input the expression in the calculator. When an expression shows the division of two expressions, be sure to use parentheses: (numerator) $\div$ (denominator). Press **\[ENTER\]** to obtain the answer $-.8\bar{8}$ or $-\frac{8}{9}$.")

Practice Set
------------

Sample explanations for some of the practice exercises below are available by viewing the following video. Note that there is not always a match between the number of the practice exercise in the video and the number of the practice exercise listed in the following exercise set.  However, the practice exercise is the same in both. [CK-12 Basic Algebra: Order of Operations](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Po3nfITsok) (14:23)

### 1.3 Patterns and Expressions

<article>

In mathematics, especially in algebra, we look for patterns in the numbers that we see. Using mathematical verbs and variables studied in lessons 1.1 and 1.2, expressions can be written to describe a pattern.

**Definition:** An **algebraic expression** is a mathematical phrase combining numbers and/or variables using mathematical operations.

![0](media/11.png "Figure 1: Consider a theme park charging an admission of $28 per person. A rule can be written to describe the relationship between the amount of money taken at the ticket booth and the number of people entering the park. In words, the relationship can be stated as “_The money taken in dollars is (equals) twenty-eight times the number of people who enter the park._”")

The English phrase above can be translated (written in another language) into an algebraic expression. Using mathematical verbs and nouns learned from previous lessons, any sentence can be written as an algebraic expression.

**Example 1:** Write an algebraic expression for the following phrase.

_The product of $c$ and 4._

**Solution:** The verb is _product_, meaning “to multiply.” Therefore, the phrase is asking for the answer found by multiplying $c$ and 4. The nouns are the number 4 and the variable $c$. The expression becomes $4 \times c, \ 4(c)$, or using shorthand, $4c$.

**Example 2:** Write an expression to describe the amount of revenue of the theme park.

**Solution:** An appropriate variable to describe the number of people could be $p$. Rewriting the English phrase into a mathematical phrase, it becomes $28 \times p$.

Using Words to Describe Patterns
--------------------------------

Sometimes patterns are given in _tabular_ format (meaning presented in a table). An important job of analysts is to describe a pattern so others can understand it.

**Example 3:** Using the table below, describe the pattern in words.

$$
\begin{align*}
&& x && -1 && 0 && 1 && 2 && 3 && 4\\
&& y && -5 && 0 && 5 && 10 && 15 && 20
\end{align*}
$$

**Solution:** We can see from the table that $y$ is five times bigger than $x$. Therefore, the pattern is that the “$y$ value is five times larger than the $x$ value.”

**Example 4:** Using the table below, describe the pattern in words and in an expression.

Zarina has a $100 gift card and has been spending money in small regular amounts. She checks the balance on the card weekly, and records the balance in the following table.

| **Week #** | **Balance ($)** |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | 100 |
| 2   | 78  |
| 3   | 56  |
| 4   | 34  |

**Solution:** Each week the amount of her gift card is $22 less than the week before. The pattern in words is: _“The gift card started at $100 and is decreasing by $22 each week.”_

The expression found in example 4 can be used to answer many situations. Suppose, for instance, that Zarina has been using her gift card for 4 weeks. By substituting the number 4 for the variable $w$, it can be determined that Zarina has $12 left on her gift card.

**Solution:**

$$
100-22w
$$

When $w = 4$, the expression becomes

$$
\begin{align*}
&100-22(4)\\
&100-88\\
&12
\end{align*}
$$

After 4 weeks, Zarina has $12 left on her gift card.

### 1.4 Equations and Inequalities

<article>

When an algebraic expression is set equal to another value, variable, or expression, a new mathematical sentence is created. This sentence is called an **equation.**

**Definition:** An **algebraic equation** is a mathematical sentence connecting an expression to a value, a variable, or another expression with an equal sign (=).

Consider the theme park situation from lesson 1.3. Suppose there is a concession stand selling burgers and French fries. Each burger costs $2.50 and each order of French fries costs $1.75. You and your family will spend exactly $25.00 on food. How many burgers can be purchased? How many orders of fries? How many of each type can be purchased if your family plans to buy a combination of burgers and fries?

![0](media/12.png "Figure 1: The underlined word exactly lends a clue to the type of mathematical sentence you will need to write to model this situation.")

These words can be used to symbolize the equal sign:

_Exactly, equivalent, the same as, identical, is_

The word _exactly_ is synonymous with equal, so this word is directing us to write an equation. Using the methods learned in lessons 1.2 and 1.3, read every word in the sentence and translate each into mathematical symbols.

**Example 1:** Your family is planning to purchase only burgers. How many can be purchased with $25.00?

**Solution:**

Step 1: Choose a variable to represent the unknown quantity, say $b$ for burgers.

Step 2: Write an equation to represent the situation: $2.50 b = 25.00$.

Step 3: Think. What number multiplied by 2.50 equals 25.00?

The solution is 10, so your family can purchase exactly ten burgers.

**Example 2:** Translate the following into equations:

a) _9 less than twice a number is_ 33.

b) _Five more than four times a number is_ 21.

c) $20.00 _was one-quarter of the money spent on pizza._

**Solutions:**

a) Let “a number” be $n$. So, twice a number is $2n$.

Nine less than that is $2n - 9$.

The word _is_ means the equal sign, so $2n - 9 = 33$.

b) Let “a number” be $x$. So five more than four times a number is 21 can be written as: $4x + 5 = 21$.

c) Let “of the money” be $m$. The equation could be written as $\frac{1}{4} m = 20.00$.

**Definition:** The **solution** to an equation or inequality is the value (or multiple values) that make the equation or inequality true.

Using statement (c) from example 2, find the solution.

![0](media/13.png "Figure 2: $$")
\frac{1}{4} m = 20.00
$$

Think: One-quarter can also be thought of as _divide by four._ What divided by 4 equals 20.00?

The solution is 80. So, the money spent on pizza was $80.00.

Checking an answer to an equation is almost as important as the equation itself. By substituting the value for the variable, you are making sure both sides of the equation balance.

**Example 3:** Check that $x = 5$ is the solution to the equation $3x + 2 = -2x + 27$.

**Solution:** To check that $x = 5$ is the solution to the equation, substitute the value of 5 for the variable, $x$:

$$
\begin{align*}
3x + 2 &= -2x + 27\\
3 \cdot x + 2 &= -2 \cdot x + 27\\
3 \cdot 5 + 2 &= -2 \cdot 5 + 27\\
15 + 2 &= -10 + 27\\
17 &= 17
\end{align*}
$$

Because $17 = 17$ is a true statement, we can conclude that $x = 5$ is a solution to $3x + 2 = -2x + 27$.

**Example 4:** Is $z = 3$ a solution to $z^2 + 2z = 8$?

**Solution:** Begin by substituting the value of 3 for $z$.

$$
\begin{align*}
3^2 + 2(3) &= 8\\
9 + 6 &= 8\\
15 &= 8
\end{align*}
$$

Because $15 = 8$ is NOT a true statement, we can conclude that $z = 3$ is not a solution to $z^2 + 2z = 8$.

Sometimes Things Are Not Equal
------------------------------

In some cases there are multiple answers to a problem or the situation requires something that is not exactly equal to another value. When a mathematical sentence involves something other than an equal sign, an **inequality** is formed.

**Definition:** An **algebraic inequality** is a mathematical sentence connecting an expression to a value, a variable, or another expression with an inequality sign.

Listed below are the most common inequality signs.

$>$ “greater than”

$\ge$ “greater than or equal to”

$\le$ “less than or equal to”

$<$ “less than”

$\neq$ “not equal to”

Below are several examples of inequalities.

$$
\begin{align*}
3x < 5 && x^2 + 2x - 1 > 0 && \frac{3x}{4} \ge \frac{x}{2} - 3 && 4 - x \le 2x
\end{align*}
$$

**Example 5:** Translate the following into an inequality: Avocados cost $1.59 per pound. How many pounds of avocados can be purchased for less than $7.00?

**Solution:** Choose a variable to represent the number of pounds of avocados purchased, say $a$.

$$
1.59(a)<7
$$

You will be asked to solve this inequality in the exercises

![0](media/14.png "Figure 3: Checking the Solution to an Inequality")
--------------------------------------

Unlike equations, inequalities typically have more than one solution. Checking solutions to inequalities is more complex than checking solutions to equations. The key to checking a solution to an inequality is to choose a number that occurs within the solution set.

**Example 6:** Check that $m \le 10$ is a solution to $4m + 30 \le 70$.

**Solution:** If the solution set is true, any value less than or equal to 10 should make the original inequality true.

Choose a value less than 10, say 4. Substitute this value for the variable $m$.

$$
\begin{align*}
&4(4) + 30\\
&16 + 30\\
&46 \le 70
\end{align*}
$$

The value found when $m = 4$ is less than 70. Therefore, the solution set is true.

Why was the value 10 not chosen? Endpoints are not chosen when checking an inequality because the direction of the inequality needs to be tested. Special care needs to be taken when checking the solutions to an inequality.

### 1.5 Functions as Rules and Tables

<article>

Instead of purchasing a one-day ticket to the theme park, Joseph decided to pay by ride. Each ride costs $2.00. To describe the amount of money Joseph will spend, several mathematical concepts can be used.

![0](media/15.png "Figure 1: First, an expression can be written to describe the relationship between the cost per ride and the number of rides, $r$. An equation can also be written if the total amount he wants to spend is known. An inequality can be used if Joseph wanted to spend less than a certain amount.")

**Example 1:** Using Joseph’s situation, write the following:

a. An expression representing his total amount spent

b. An equation that shows Joseph wants to spend exactly $22.00 on rides

c. An inequality that describes the fact that Joseph will not spend more than $26.00 on rides

**Solution:** The variable in this situation is the number of rides Joseph will pay for. Call this $r$.

a. $2(r)$

b. $2(r) = 22$

c. $2(r) \le 26$

In addition to an expression, equation, or inequality, Joseph’s situation can be expressed in the form of a function or a table.

**Definition:** A **function** is a relationship between two variables such that the input value has ONLY one output value.

Writing Equations as Functions
------------------------------

A function is a set of ordered pairs in which the first coordinate, usually $x$, matches with exactly one second coordinate, $y$. Equations that follow this definition can be written in function notation. The $y$ coordinate represents the **dependent variable**, meaning the values of this variable depend upon what is substituted for the other variable.

Consider Joseph’s equation $m = 2r$. Using function notation, the value of the equation (the money spent $m$) is replaced with $f(r)$. $f$ represents the function name and $(r)$ represents the variable. In this case the parentheses do not mean multiplication; they separate the function name from the **independent variable.**

&nbsp;

$$
\begin{align*}
& \quad \ input\\
& \quad \ \ \ \downarrow\\
& \quad \underbrace{f(x)}= y \leftarrow output\\
& \ function\\
& \quad \ \ box
\end{align*}
$$

**Example 2:** Rewrite the following equations in function notation.

a. $y=7x-3$

b. $d=65t$

c. $F=1.8C+32$

**Solution:**

a. According to the definition of a function, $y=f(x)$, so $f(x)=7x-3$.

b. This time the dependent variable is $d$. Function notation replaces the dependent variable, so $d = f(t) = 65t$.

c. $F = f(C) = 1.8C + 32$

Why Use Function Notation?
--------------------------

Why is it necessary to use function notation? The necessity stems from using multiple equations. Function notation allows one to easily decipher between the equations. Suppose Joseph, Lacy, Kevin, and Alfred all went to the theme park together and chose to pay $2.00 for each ride. Each person would have the same equation $m=2r$. Without asking each friend, we could not tell which equation belonged to whom. By substituting function notation for the dependent variable, it is easy to tell which function belongs to whom. By using function notation, it will be much easier to graph multiple lines (Chapter 4).

**Example 3:** Write functions to represent the total each friend spent at the park.

**Solution:** $J(r)= 2r$ represents Joseph’s total, $L(r)= 2r$ represents Lacy's total, $K(r)= 2r$ represents Kevin's total, and $A(r)= 2r$ represents Alfred’s total.

Using a Function to Generate a Table
------------------------------------

A function really is an equation. Therefore, a table of values can be created by choosing values to represent the **independent variable.** The answers to each substitution represent $f(x)$.

Use Joseph’s function to generate a table of values. Because the variable represents the number of rides Joseph will pay for, negative values do not make sense and are not included in the value of the independent variable.

| $R$ | $J(r) = 2r$ |
| --- | --- |
| 0   | $2(0) = 0$ |
| 1   | $2(1) = 2$ |
| 2   | $2(2) = 4$ |
| 3   | $2(3) = 6$ |
| 4   | $2(4) = 8$ |
| 5   | $2(5) = 10$ |
| 6   | $2(6) = 12$ |

As you can see, the list cannot include every possibility. A table allows for precise organization of data. It also provides an easy reference for looking up data and offers a set of coordinate points that can be plotted to create a graphical representation of the function. A table does have limitations; namely it cannot represent infinite amounts of data and it does not always show the possibility of fractional values for the independent variable.

Domain and Range of a Function
------------------------------

The set of all possible input values for the independent variable is called the **domain.** The domain can be expressed in words, as a set, or as an inequality. The values resulting from the substitution of the domain represent the **range** of a function.

The domain of Joseph’s situation will not include negative numbers because it does not make sense to ride negative rides. He also cannot ride a fraction of a ride, so decimals and fractional values do not make sense as input values. Therefore, the values of the independent variable _r_ will be whole numbers beginning at zero.

Domain: All whole numbers

The values resulting from the substitution of whole numbers are whole numbers times two. Therefore, the **range** of Joseph’s situation is still whole numbers just twice as large.

Range: All even whole numbers

**Example 4:** A tennis ball is bounced from a height and bounces back to 75% of its previous height. Write its function and determine its domain and range.

**Solution:** The function of this situation is $h(b)= 0.75b$, where $b$ represents the previous bounce height.

Domain: The previous bounce height can be any positive number, so $b \ge 0$.

Range: The new height is 75% of the previous height, and therefore will also be any positive number (decimal or whole number), so the range is **all positive real numbers.**

**Multimedia Link** For another look at the domain of a function, see the following video where the narrator solves a sample problem from the California Standards Test about finding the domain of an unusual function. [Khan Academy CA Algebra I Functions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRB6s77nx2g) (6:34)

Write a Function Rule
---------------------

In many situations, data is collected by conducting a survey or an experiment. To visualize the data, it is arranged into a table. Most often, a function rule is needed to predict additional values of the independent variable.

**Example 5:** _Write a function rule for the table._

$$
\begin{align*}
& \text{Number of CDs} && 2 && 4 && 6 && 8 && 10\\
& \text{Cost}\ (\$) && 24 && 48  && 72  && 96  && 120
\end{align*}
$$

![0](media/16.png "Figure 2: **Solution:** You pay $24 for 2 CDs, $48 for 4 CDs, and $120 for 10 CDs. That means that each CD costs $12.")

We can write the function rule.

$\text{Cost} = \$12 \times  \text{number of CDs}$ or $f(x) = 12x$

**Example 6:** _Write a function rule for the table._

$$
\begin{align*}
&& x && -3  && -2 && -1 && 0 && 1 && 2 && 3\\
&& y && \quad 3 && \quad 2 && \quad 1 && 0 && 1 && 2 && 3
\end{align*}
$$

**Solution:** The values of the dependent variable are always the positive outcomes of the input values. This relationship has a special name, the absolute value. The function rule looks like this: $f(x) = |x|$.

Represent a Real-World Situation with a Function
------------------------------------------------

Let’s look at a real-world situation that can be represented by a function.

**Example 7:** _Maya has an internet service that currently has a monthly access fee of $11.95 and a connection fee of $0.50 per hour. Represent her monthly cost as a function of connection time._

**Solution:** Let $x=$ the number of hours Maya spends on the internet in one month and let $y=$ Maya’s monthly cost. The monthly fee is $11.95 with an hourly charge of $0.50.

The total cost $=$ flat fee $+$ hourly fee $\times$ number of hours. The function is $y = f(x) = 11.95 + 0.50x$

### 1.6 Functions as Graphs

<article>

Once a table has been created for a function, the next step is to visualize the relationship by graphing the coordinates _(independent value, dependent value)._ In previous courses, you have learned how to plot ordered pairs on a coordinate plane. The first coordinate represents the horizontal distance from the origin (the point where the axes intersect). The second coordinate represents the vertical distance from the origin.

![0](media/17.png "Figure 1: To graph a coordinate point such as (4,2) we start at the origin.")

Because the first coordinate is positive four, we move 4 units to the right.

From this location, since the second coordinate is positive two, we move 2 units up.

![0](media/18.png "Figure 2: **Example 1:** _Plot the following coordinate points on the Cartesian plane._")

(a) (5, 3)

(b) (–2, 6)

(c) (3, –4)

(d) (–5, –7)

**Solution:** We show all the coordinate points on the same plot.

![0](media/19.png "Figure 3: Notice that:")

For a positive $x$ value we move to the right.

For a negative $x$ value we move to the left.

For a positive $y$ value we move up.

For a negative $y$ value we move down.

When referring to a coordinate plane, also called a Cartesian plane, the four sections are called **quadrants.** The first quadrant is the upper right section, the second quadrant is the upper left, the third quadrant is the lower left and the fourth quadrant is the lower right.

![0](media/20.png "Figure 4: Suppose we wanted to visualize Joseph’s total cost of riding at the amusement park. Using the table generated in Lesson 1.5, the graph can be constructed as (number of rides, total cost).")

| $r$ | $J(r) = 2r$ |
| --- | --- |
| 0   | $2(0) = 0$ |
| 1   | $2(1) = 2$ |
| 2   | $2(2) = 4$ |
| 3   | $2(3) = 6$ |
| 4   | $2(4) = 8$ |
| 5   | $2(5) = 10$ |
| 6   | $2(6) = 12$ |

![0](media/21.png "Figure 5: The green dots represent the combination of $(r, J(r))$. The dots are not connected because the domain of this function is all whole numbers. By connecting the points we are indicating that all values between the ordered pairs are also solutions to this function. Can Joseph ride $2 \frac{1}{2}$ rides? Of course not! Therefore, we leave this situation as a **scatter plot.**")

**Example 2:** Graph the function that has the following table of values.

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{Side of the Square} && 0 && 1 && 2 && 3 && 4\\
&\text{Area of the Square} && 0 && 1 && 4 && 9 && 16
\end{align*}
$$

**Solution:** The table gives us five sets of coordinate points:

(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16).

To graph the function, we plot all the coordinate points. Because the length of a square can be fractional values, but not negative, the domain of this function is all positive real numbers, or $x \ge 0$. This means the ordered pairs can be connected with a smooth curve. This curve will continue forever in the positive direction, shown by an arrow.

![0](media/22.png "Figure 6: Writing a Function Rule Using a Graph")
-------------------------------------

In many cases, you are given a graph and asked to determine its function. From a graph, you can read pairs of coordinate points that are on the curve of the function. The coordinate points give values of dependent and independent variables. These variables are related to each other by a rule. It is important we make sure this rule works for all the points on the curve.

In this course, you will learn to recognize different kinds of functions. There will be specific methods that you can use for each type of function that will help you find the function rule. For now, we will look at some basic examples and find patterns that will help us figure out the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

**Example 3:** The graph below shows the distance that an inchworm covers over time. Find the function rule that shows how distance and time are related to each other.

![0](media/23.png "Figure 7: **Solution:** Make table of values of several coordinate points to identify a pattern.")

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{Time} && 0 && 1 && 2 && 3 && 4 && 5 && 6\\
&\text{Distance} && 0 && 1.5 && 3 && 4.5 && 6 && 7.5 && 9
\end{align*}
$$

We can see that for every minute the distance increases by 1.5 feet. We can write the function rule as:

$\text{Distance} = 1.5 \times \ \text{time}$

The equation of the function is $f(x) = 1.5x$

Analyze the Graph of a Real-World Situation
-------------------------------------------

Graphs are used to represent data in all areas of life. You can find graphs in newspapers, political campaigns, science journals, and business presentations.

Here is an example of a graph you might see reported in the news. Most mainstream scientists believe that increased emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, are contributing to the warming of the planet. The graph below illustrates how carbon dioxide levels have increased as the world has industrialized.

![0](media/24.png "Figure 8: From this graph, we can find the concentration of carbon dioxide found in the atmosphere in different years.")

1900 - 285 parts per million

1930 - 300 parts per million

1950 - 310 parts per million

1990 - 350 parts per million

In Chapter 9, you will learn how to approximate an equation to fit this data using a graphing calculator.

Determining Whether a Relation Is a Function
--------------------------------------------

You saw that a function is a **relation** between the independent and the dependent variables. It is a rule that uses the values of the independent variable to give the values of the dependent variable. A function rule can be expressed in words, as an equation, as a table of values, and as a graph. All representations are useful and necessary in understanding the relation between the variables.

**Definition:** A **relation** is a set of ordered pairs.

Mathematically, a function is a special kind of relation.

**Definition:** A **function** is a relation between two variables such that the independent value has EXACTLY one dependent value.

This usually means that each $x-$value has only one $y-$value assigned to it. But, not all functions involve $x$ and $y$.

Consider the relation that shows the heights of all students in a class. The domain is the set of people in the class and the range is the set of heights. Each person in the class cannot be more than one height at the same time. This relation is a function because for each person there is exactly one height that belongs to him or her.

![0](media/25.png "Figure 9: Notice that in a function, a value in the range can belong to more than one element in the domain, so more than one person in the class can have the same height. The opposite is not possible, one person cannot have multiple heights.")

**Example 4:** _Determine if the relation is a function._

a) (1, 3), (–1, –2), (3, 5), (2, 5), (3, 4)

b) (–3, 20), (–5, 25), (–1, 5), (7, 12), (9, 2)

**Solution:**

a) To determine whether this relation is a function, we must follow the definition of a function. Each $x-$coordinate can have ONLY one $y-$coordinate. However, since the $x-$coordinate of 3 has two $y-$coordinates, 4 and 5, this relation is NOT a function.

b) Applying the definition of a function, each $x-$coordinate has only one $y-$coordinate. Therefore, this relation is a function.

Determining Whether a Graph Is a Function
-----------------------------------------

One way to determine whether a relation is a function is to construct a **flow chart** linking each dependent value to its matching independent value. Suppose, however, all you are given is the graph of the relation. How can you determine whether it is a function?

You could organize the ordered pairs into a table or a flow chart, similar to the student and height situation. This could be a lengthy process, but it is one possible way. A second way is to use the **Vertical Line Test.** Applying this test gives a quick and effective visual to decide if the graph is a function.

**Theorem:** Part A) A relation is a function if there are no vertical lines that intersect the graphed relation in more than one point.

Part B) If a graphed relation does not intersect a vertical line in more than one point, then that relation is a function.

Is this graphed relation a function?

![0](media/26.png "Figure 10: By drawing a vertical line (the red line) through the graph, we can see that the vertical line intersects the circle more than once. Therefore, this graph is NOT a function.")

Here is a second example:

![0](media/27.png "Figure 11: No matter where a vertical line is drawn through the graph, there will be only one intersection. Therefore, this graph is a function.")

**Example 4:** _Determine if the relation is a function._

![0](media/28.png "Figure 12: **Solution:** Using the Vertical Line Test, we can conclude the relation is a function.")

### 1.7 A Problem-Solving Plan

<article>

Much of mathematics apply to real-world situations. To think critically and to problem solve are mathematical abilities. Although these capabilities may be the most challenging, they are also the most rewarding.

To be successful in applying mathematics in real-life situations, you must have a “toolbox” of strategies to assist you. The last few lessons of many chapters in this FlexBook® textbook are devoted to filling this toolbox so you to become a better problem solver and tackle mathematics in the real world.

Step #1: Read and Understand the Given Problem
----------------------------------------------

Every problem you encounter gives you clues needed to solve it successfully. Here is a checklist you can use to help you understand the problem.

$\surd$ Read the problem carefully. Make sure you read all the sentences. Many mistakes have been made by failing to fully read the situation.

$\surd$ Underline or highlight key words. These include mathematical operations such as _sum, difference, product,_ and mathematical verbs such as _equal, more than, less than, is._ Key words also include the nouns the situation is describing such as _time, distance, people,_ etc.

$\surd$ Ask yourself if you have seen a problem like this before. Even though the nouns and verbs may be different, the general situation may be similar to something else you’ve seen.

$\surd$ What are you being asked to do? What is the question you are supposed to answer?

$\surd$ What facts are you given? These typically include numbers or other pieces of information.

Once you have discovered what the problem is about, the next step is to declare what variables will represent the nouns in the problem. Remember to use letters that make sense!

Step #2: Make a Plan to Solve the Problem
-----------------------------------------

The next step in the problem-solving plan is to **make a plan** or **develop a strategy.** How can the information you know assist you in figuring out the unknown quantities?

Here are some common strategies that you will learn.

![0](media/37.png "Figure 1: * Drawing a diagram")
* Making a table
* Looking for a pattern
* Using guess and check
* Working backwards
* Using a formula
* Reading and making graphs
* Writing equations
* Using linear models
* Using dimensional analysis
* Using the right type of function for the situation

In most problems, you will use a combination of strategies. For example, drawing a diagram and looking for patterns are good strategies for most problems. Also, making a table and drawing a graph are often used together. The “writing an equation” strategy is the one you will work with the most frequently in your study of algebra.

Step #3: Solve the Problem and Check the Results
------------------------------------------------

Once you develop a plan, you can use it to **solve the problem.**

The last step in solving any problem should always be to **check and interpret** the answer. Here are some questions to help you to do that.

* Does the answer make sense?
* If you substitute the solution into the original problem, does it make the sentence true?
* Can you use another method to arrive at the same answer?

Step #4: Compare Alternative Approaches
---------------------------------------

Sometimes a certain problem is best solved by using a specific method. Most of the time, however, it can be solved by using several different strategies. When you are familiar with all of the problem-solving strategies, it is up to you to choose the methods that you are most comfortable with and that make sense to you. In this book, we will often use more than one method to solve a problem. This way we can demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of different strategies when applied to different types of problems.

Regardless of the strategy you are using, you should always implement the problem-solving plan when you are solving word problems. Here is a summary of the problem-solving plan.

**Step 1:** Understand the problem.

**Step 2:** Devise a plan – Translate. Come up with a way to solve the problem. Set up an equation, draw a diagram, make a chart, or construct a table as a start to begin your problem-solving plan.

**Step 3:** Carry out the plan – Solve.

**Step 4:** Check and Interpret: Check to see if you have used all your information. Then look to see if the answer makes sense.

Solve Real-World Problems Using a Plan
--------------------------------------

**Example 1:** Jeff is 10 years old. His younger brother, Ben, is 4 years old. How old will Jeff be when he is twice as old as Ben?

**Solution:** Begin by understanding the problem. Highlight the key words.

**Jeff** is **10** years old. His younger brother, **Ben**, is **4** years old. **How old** will Jeff be **when he is twice as old as Ben**?

The question we need to answer is. “What is Jeff’s age when he is twice as old as Ben?”

You could guess and check, use a formula, make a table, or look for a pattern.

The key is “twice as old.” This clue means two times, or double Ben’s age. Begin by doubling possible ages. Let’s look for a pattern.

$4 \times 2 = 8$. Jeff is already older than 8.

$5 \times 2 = 10$. This doesn’t make sense because Jeff is already 10.

$6 \times 2 = 12$. In two years, Jeff will be 12 and Ben will be 6. Jeff will be twice as old.

Jeff will be 12 years old.

**Example 2:** Matthew is planning to harvest his corn crop this fall. The field has 660 rows of corn with 300 ears per row. Matthew estimates his crew will have the crop harvested in 20 hours. How many ears of corn will his crew harvest per hour?

![0](media/38.png "Figure 2: **Solution:** Begin by highlighting the key information.")

Matthew is planning to harvest his corn crop this fall. The field has **660 rows** of corn with **300 ears per row**. Matthew estimates his crew will have the **crop harvested in 20 hours. How many ears of corn** will his crew **harvest per hour**?

You could draw a picture (it may take a while), write an equation, look for a pattern, or make a table. Let’s try to use reasoning.

We need to figure out how many ears of corn are in the field. $660(300) = 198,000$. This is how many ears are in the field. It will take 20 hours to harvest the entire field, so we need to divide 198,000 by 20 to get the number of ears picked per hour.

$$
\frac{198,000}{20} = 9,900
$$

The crew can harvest 9,900 ears per hour.

### 1.8 Problem-Solving Strategies: Make a Table; Look for a Pattern

<article>

This lesson focuses on two of the strategies introduced in the previous chapter: making a table and looking for a pattern. These are the most common strategies you have used before algebra. Let’s review the four-step problem-solving plan from Lesson 1.7.

**Step 1:** Understand the problem.

**Step 2:** Devise a plan – Translate. Come up with a way to solve the problem. Set up an equation, draw a diagram, make a chart, or construct a table as a start to begin your problem-solving plan.

**Step 3:** Carry out the plan – Solve.

**Step 4:** Check and Interpret: Check to see if you used all your information. Then look to see if the answer makes sense.

Using a Table to Solve a Problem
--------------------------------

When a problem has data that needs to be organized, a table is a highly effective problem-solving strategy. A table is also helpful when the problem asks you to record a large amount of information. Patterns and numerical relationships are easier to see when data are organized in a table.

**Example 1:** _Josie takes up jogging. In the first week she jogs for 10 minutes per day, in the second week she jogs for 12 minutes per day. Each week, she wants to increase her jogging time by 2 minutes per day. If she jogs six days per week each week, what will be her total jogging time in the sixth week?_

**Solution:** Organize the information in a table

| **Week 1** | **Week 2** | **Week 3** | **Week 4** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **10 minutes** | **12 minutes** | **14 minutes** | **16 minutes** |
| **60 min/week** | **72 min/week** | **84 min/week** | **96 min/week** |

We can see the pattern that the number of minutes is increasing by 12 each week. Continuing this pattern, Josie will run 120 minutes in the sixth week.

Don’t forget to check the solution! The pattern starts at 60 and adds 12 each week after the first week. The equation to represent this situation is $t = 60 + 12(w - 1)$. By substituting 6 for the variable of $w$, the equation becomes $t = 60 + 12(6 - 1) = 60 + 60 = 120$

Solve a Problem by Looking for a Pattern
----------------------------------------

Some situations have a readily apparent pattern, which means that the pattern is easy to see. In this case, you may not need to organize the information into a table. Instead, you can use the pattern to arrive at your solution.

**Example 2:** _You arrange tennis balls in triangular shapes as shown. How many balls will there be in a triangle that has 8 layers?_

![0](media/40.png "Figure 1: **One layer:** It is simple to see that a triangle with one layer has only one ball.")

![0](media/41.png "Figure 2: **Two layers:** For a triangle with two layers we add the balls from the top layer to the balls of the bottom layer. It is useful to make a sketch of the different layers in the triangle.")

![0](media/42.png "Figure 3: **Three layers:** we add the balls from the top triangle to the balls from the bottom layer.")

![0](media/43.png "Figure 4: We can fill the first three rows of the table.")

$$
\begin{align*}
&1 && 2 && 3 && \quad \ \ 4\\
&1 && 3 && 6 && 6 + 4 = 10
\end{align*}
$$

To find the number of tennis balls in 8 layers, continue the pattern.

&nbsp;

$$
\begin{align*}
& \qquad \ 5 && \qquad \ 6 && \qquad \ 7 && \qquad \ 8\\
&10+5=15 && 15+6=21 && 21+7=28 && 28+8=36
\end{align*}
$$

There will be 36 tennis balls in the 8 layers.

**Check:** Each layer of the triangle has one more ball than the previous one. In a triangle with 8 layers, each layer has the same number of balls as its position. When we add these we get:

$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36$ balls

**The answer checks out.**

Comparing Alternative Approaches to Solving Problems
----------------------------------------------------

In this section, we will compare the methods of “Making a Table” and “Looking for a Pattern” by using each method in turn to solve a problem.

**Example 3:** _Andrew cashes a $180 check and wants the money in $10 and $20 bills. The bank teller gives him 12 bills. How many of each kind of bill does he receive?_

**Solution:** **Method 1: Making a Table**

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{Tens} && 0 && 2 && 4 && 6 && 8 && 10 && 12 && 14 && 16 && 18\\
&\text{Twenties} && 9 && 8 && 7 && 6 && 5 && 4 && 3 && 2 && 1 && 0
\end{align*}
$$

The combination that has a sum of 12 is six $10 bills and six $20 bills.

**Method 2: Using a Pattern**

The pattern is that for every pair of $10 bills, the number of $20 bills reduces by one. Begin with the most number of $20 bills. For every $20 bill lost, add two $10 bills.

$$
6(\$10) + 6(\$20) = \$180
$$

**Check:** Six $10 bills and six $20 bills $=6(\$10) + 6(\$20) = \$60 + \$120 = \$180$.

Using These Strategies to Solve Problems
----------------------------------------

**Example 4:** _Students are going to march in a homecoming parade. There will be one kindergartener, two first-graders, three second-graders, and so on through $12^{th}$ grade. How many students will be walking in the homecoming parade?_

Could you make a table? Absolutely. Could you look for a pattern? Absolutely.

**Solution 1:** Make a table:

$$
\begin{align*}
&& K && 1 && 2 && 3 && 4 && 5 && 6 && 7 && 8 && 9 && 10 && 11 && 12\\
&&1 && 2 && 3 && 4 && 5 && 6 && 7 && 8 && 9 && 10 && 11 && 12 && 13
\end{align*}
$$

The solution is the sum of all the numbers, 91. There will be 91 students walking in the homecoming parade.

**Solution 2:** Look for a pattern.

The pattern is: The number of students is one more than their grade level. Therefore, the solution is the sum of numbers from 1 (kindergarten) through 13 ($12^{th}$ grade). The solution is 91.

## 2.0 Properties of Real Numbers

<article>

Real numbers are all around us. The majority of numbers calculated are considered **real numbers.** This chapter defines a real number and explains important properties and rules that apply to real numbers.



</article>

### 2.1 Integers and Rational Numbers

<article>

Integers and rational numbers are important in daily life. The price per square yard of carpet is a rational number. The number of frogs in a pond is expressed using an integer. The organization of real numbers can be drawn as a **hierarchy**. Look at the hierarchy below.

![0](media/48.png "Figure 1: The most generic number is the real number; it can be a combination of negative, positive, decimal, fractional, or non-repeating decimal values. Real numbers have two major categories: rational numbers and irrational numbers. **Irrational numbers** are non-repeating, non-terminating decimals such as $\pi$ or $\sqrt{2}$. The discussion in this lesson revolves around **rational numbers**.")

**Definition:** A **rational number** is a number that can be written in the form $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers _and_ $b \ne 0$.

A Review of Fractions
---------------------

You can think of a rational number as a fraction of a cake. If you cut the cake into $b$ slices, your share is $a$ of those slices. For example, when we see the rational number $\frac{1}{2}$, we imagine cutting the cake into two parts. Our share is one of those parts. Visually, the rational number $\frac{1}{2}$ looks like this.

![0](media/49.png "Figure 2: There are three main types of fractions:")

* **Proper fractions** are rational numbers where the numerator is less than the denominator. A proper fraction represents a number less than one. With a proper fraction you always end up with less than a whole cake!
* **Improper fractions** are rational numbers where the numerator is greater than the denominator. Improper fractions can be rewritten as a mixed number – an integer plus a proper fraction. An improper fraction represents a number greater than one.
* **Equivalent fractions** are two fractions that give the same numerical value when evaluated. For example, look at a visual representation of the rational number $\frac{2}{4}$.

![0](media/50.png "Figure 3: The visual of $\frac{1}{2}$ is equivalent to the visual of $\frac{2}{4}$. We can write out the prime factors of both the numerator and the denominator and cancel matching factors that appear in both the numerator **and** denominator.")

$\left (\frac{2}{4}\right ) = \left (\frac{\cancel{2}\cdot 1}{\cancel{2}\cdot 2 \cdot 1}\right )$ We then re-multiply the remaining factors. $\left (\frac{2}{4}\right ) = \left (\frac{1}{2}\right )$

Therefore, $\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}$. This process is called **reducing** the fraction, or writing the fraction in lowest terms. Reducing a fraction does not change the value of the fraction; it simplifies the way we write it. When we have canceled all common factors, we have a fraction in its **simplest form**.

**Example 1:** _Classify and simplify the following rational numbers_.

a) $\left (\frac{3}{7}\right )$

b) $\left (\frac{9}{3}\right )$

c) $\left (\frac{50}{60}\right )$

**Solution:**

a) Because both 3 and 7 are prime numbers, $\frac{3}{7}$ is a proper fraction written in its simplest form.

b) The numerator is larger than the denominator; therefore, this is an improper fraction.

$$
\frac{9}{3}= \frac{3 \times 3}{3}= \frac{3}{1}=3
$$

c) This is a proper fraction; $\frac{50}{60}= \frac{5 \times 2 \times 5}{6 \times 2 \times 5}= \frac{5}{6}$

Ordering Rational Numbers
-------------------------

To order rational numbers is to arrange them according to a set of directions, such as ascending (lowest to highest) or descending (highest to lowest). Ordering rational numbers is useful when determining which unit cost is the cheapest.

**Example 2:** _Cans of tomato sauce come in three sizes: 8 ounces, 16 ounces, and 32 ounces. The costs for each size are $0.59, $0.99, and $1.29, respectively. Find the unit cost and order the rational numbers in ascending order._

**Solution:** Use proportions to find the cost per ounce. $\frac{\$0.59}{8} = \frac{\$0.07375}{ounce}; \ \frac{\$0.99}{16} = \frac{\$0.061875}{ounce}; \ \frac{\$1.29}{32} = \frac{\$0.0403125}{ounce}$. Arranging the rational numbers in ascending order: 0.0403125, 0.061875, 0.07375

**Example 3:** _Which is greater_ $\frac{3}{7}$ _or_ $\frac{4}{9}$?

**Solution:** Begin by creating a common denominator for these two fractions. Which number is evenly divisible by 7 and 9? $7 \times 9 = 63$, therefore the common denominator is 63.

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{3 \times 9}{7 \times 9} = \frac{27}{63} && \frac{4 \times 7}{9 \times 7} = \frac{28}{63}
\end{align*}
$$

Because $28 > 27, \ \frac{4}{9} > \frac{3}{7}$

For more information regarding how to order fractions, watch this YouTube video.

[Khan Academy: Ordering Fractions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Llt-KkHugRQ)

Graph and Compare Integers
--------------------------

More specific than the rational numbers are the **integers.** Integers are whole numbers and their negatives. When comparing integers, you will use the math verbs such as less than, greater than, approximately equal to, and equal to. To graph an integer on a number line, place a dot above the number you want to represent.

**Example 4:** _Compare the numbers 2 and –5._

**Solution:** First, we will plot the two numbers on a number line.

![0](media/51.png "Figure 4: We can compare integers by noting which is the **greatest** and which is the **least.** The **greatest** number is farthest to the right, and the **least** is farthest to the left.")

In the diagram above, we can see that 2 is farther to the right on the number line than –5, so we say that 2 is greater than –5. We use the symbol > to mean “greater than.”

Therefore, $2 > -5$.

Numbers and Their Opposites
---------------------------

Every number has an **opposite,** which represents the same distance from zero but in the other direction.

![0](media/52.png "Figure 5: A special situation arises when adding a number to its opposite. The sum is zero. This is summarized in the following property.")

The **Additive Inverse Property:** For any real number $a, \ a + (- a) = 0$.

Absolute Value
--------------

**Absolute value** represents the distance from zero when graphed on a number line. For example, the number 7 is 7 units away from zero. The number –7 is also 7 units away from zero. The absolute value of a number is the distance it is from zero, so the absolute value of 7 and the absolute value of –7 are both 7.

We **write** the absolute value of –7 like this $|-7|$

We **read** the expression $|x|$ like this: “the absolute value of $x$.”

* Treat absolute value expressions like parentheses. If there is an operation inside the absolute value symbols, evaluate that operation first.
* The absolute value of a number or an expression is **always** positive or zero. It cannot be negative. With absolute value, we are only interested in how far a number is from zero, not the direction.

**Example 5:** _Evaluate the following absolute value expressions._

a) $|5 + 4|$

b) $3 - |4 - 9|$

c) $|-5 - 11|$

d) $-|7-22|$

**Solution:**

a) 

$$
\begin{align*}
|5 + 4| &= |9|\\
&= 9
\end{align*}
$$

b) 

$$
\begin{align*}
3 - |4 - 9| &= 3 - |-5|\\
&= 3 - 5\\
&= -2
\end{align*}
$$

c) 

$$
\begin{align*}
|-5-11|&=|-16|\\
&= 16
\end{align*}
$$

d) 

$$
\begin{align*}
-|7 - 22| &= -|-15|\\
&= -(15)\\
&= -15
\end{align*}
$$

### 2.2 Addition of Rational Numbers

<article>

A football team gains 11 yards on one play then loses 5 yards on another play and loses 2 yards on the third play. What is the total yardage loss or gain?

A loss can be expressed as a negative integer. A gain can be expressed as a positive integer. To find the net gain or loss, the individual values must be added together. Therefore, the sum is $11 + (-5) + (-2) = 4$. The team has a net gain of 4 yards.

Addition can also be shown using a number line. If you need to add $2 + 3$, start by making a point at the value of 2 and move three integers to the right. The ending value represents the sum of the values.

![0](media/58.png "Figure 1: **Example 1:** _Find the sum of $-2 + 3$ using a number line._")

**Solution:** Begin by making a point at –2 and moving three units to the right. The final value is 1, so $-2 + 3 = 1.$

![0](media/59.png "Figure 2: When the value that is being added is positive, we jump to the right. If the value is negative, we jump to the left (in a negative direction).")

**Example 2:** _Find the sum of $2 - 3$ using a number line._

**Solution:** Begin by making a point at 2. The expression represents subtraction, so we will count three jumps to the left.

![0](media/60.png "Figure 3: The solution is: $2 - 3 = -1$")

Algebraic Properties of Addition
--------------------------------

In Lesson 2.1, you learned the Additive Inverse Property. This property states that the sum of a number and its opposite is zero. Algebra has many other properties that help you manipulate and organize information.

The **Commutative Property of Addition:** For all real numbers $a$,and $b$, $a + b = b + a$.

To _commute_ means to change locations, so the Commutative Property of Addition allows you to rearrange the objects in an addition problem.

The **Associative Property of Addition:** For all real numbers $a, \ b,$ and $c$, $(a + b)+ c = a + (b + c).$

To _associate_ means to group together, so the Associative Property of Addition allows you to regroup the objects in an addition problem.

The **Identity Property of Addition:** For any real number $a, \ a + 0 = a.$

This property allows you to use the fact that the sum of any number and zero is the original value.

**Example 3:** _Simplify the following using the properties of addition:_

a) $9 + ( 1 + 22)$

b) $4,211 + 0$

**Solution:**

a) It is easier to regroup $9 + 1$, so by applying the Associative Property of Addition, $(9 + 1) + 22 = 10 + 22 = 32.$

b) The Additive Identity Property states the sum of a number and zero is itself; therefore, $4,211 + 0 = 4,211.$

Nadia and Peter are building sand castles on the beach. Nadia built a castle two feet tall, stopped for ice-cream, and then added one more foot to her castle. Peter built a castle one foot tall before stopping for a sandwich. After his sandwich, he built up his castle by two more feet. Whose castle is the taller?

![0](media/61.png "Figure 4: Nadia’s castle is $(2 + 1)$ feet tall. Peter’s castle is $(1 + 2)$ feet tall. According to the **Commutative Property of Addition,** the two castles are the same height.")

Adding Rational Numbers
-----------------------

To add rational numbers, we must first remember how to rewrite mixed numbers as improper fractions. Begin by multiplying the denominator of the mixed number to the whole value. Add the numerator to this product. This value is the numerator of the improper fraction. The denominator is the original.

**Example 4:** _Write_ $11 \frac{2}{3}$ as an improper fraction:

**Solution:** $3 \times 11 = 33 + 2 = 35$. This is the numerator of the improper fraction.

$$
11 \frac{2}{3} = \frac{35}{3}
$$

Now that we know how to rewrite a mixed number as an improper fraction, we can begin to add rational numbers. There is one thing to remember when finding the sum or difference of rational numbers: The denominators must be equivalent.

The **Addition Property of Fractions:** For all real numbers $a, \ b,$ and $c, \ \frac{a}{c} + \frac{b}{c} = \frac{a+b}{c}.$

### 2.3 Subtraction of Rational Numbers

<article>

In the previous two lessons, you have learned how to find the opposite of a rational number and to add rational numbers. You can use these two concepts to subtract rational numbers. Suppose you want to find the difference of 9 and 12. Symbolically, it would be $9 - 12$. Begin by placing a dot at nine and move to the **left** 12 units.

![0](media/64.png "Figure 1: $$")
9 - 12 = -3
$$

**Rule:** To subtract a number, add its opposite.

$$
\begin{align*}
3 - 5 = 3 + (-5) = -2 && 9 - 16 = 9 + (-16) = -7
\end{align*}
$$

A special case of this rule can be written when trying to subtract a negative number.

The **Opposite-Opposite Property:** For any real numbers $a$ and $b, \ a-(-b) = a + b$.

**Example 1:** _Simplify_ $-6 - (-13).$

**Solution:** Using the Opposite-Opposite Property, the double negative is rewritten as a positive.

$$
-6 - (-13) = -6 + 13 = 7
$$

**Example 2:** _Simplify_ $\frac{5}{6} - \left ( - \frac{1}{18} \right ).$

**Solution:** Begin by using the Opposite-Opposite Property.

$$
\frac{5}{6} + \frac{1}{18}
$$

Next, create a common denominator: $\frac{5 \times 3}{6 \times 3} + \frac{1}{18} = \frac{15}{18} + \frac{1}{18}.$

Add the fractions: $\frac{16}{18}.$

Reduce: $\frac{2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2}{3 \times 3 \times 2} = \frac{8}{9}.$

Evaluating Change Using a Variable Expression
---------------------------------------------

You have learned how to graph a function by using an algebraic expression to generate a table of values. Using the table of values you can find the **change in the dependent values** between any two independent values.

In Lesson 1.5, you wrote an expression to represent the pattern of the total cost to the number of CDs purchased. The table is repeated below:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{Number of CDs} && 2 && 4 && 6 && 8 && 10\\
&\text{Cost (\$)} && 24 && 48 && 72 && 96 && 120
\end{align*}
$$

To determine the change, you must find the difference between the **dependent values** and divide it by the difference in the **independent values.**

**Example 2:** _What is the cost of a CD?_

**Solution:** We begin by finding the difference between the cost of two values. For example, the change in cost between 4 CDs and 8 CDs.

$$
96-48 = 48
$$

Next, we find the difference between the number of CDs.

$$
\begin{align*}
&&&8 - 4  = 4\\
&\text{Finally, we divide.}&& \quad \frac{48}{4}=12
\end{align*}
$$

### 2.4 Multiplication of Rational Numbers

<article>

When you began learning how to multiply whole numbers, you replaced repeated addition with the multiplication sign $(\times)$. For example,

$$
6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 5 \times 6 = 30
$$

Multiplying rational numbers is performed the same way. We will start with the Multiplication Property of –1.

The **Multiplication Property of –1:** For any real numbers $a, (-1) \times a = -a$.

This can be summarized by saying, "A number times a negative is the opposite of the number."

**Example 1:** _Evaluate_ $-1 \cdot 9,876$.

**Solution:** Using the Multiplication Property of $-1$:  $\ -1 \cdot 9,876 = -9,876$.

This property can also be used when the values are negative, as shown in Example 2.

**Example 2:** _Evaluate_ $-1 \cdot -322$.

**Solution:** Using the Multiplication Property of $-1$:  $\ -1 \cdot -322 = 322$.

A basic algebraic property is the Multiplicative Identity. Similar to the Additive Identity, this property states that any value multiplied by 1 will result in the original value.

The **Multiplicative Identity Property:** For any real numbers $a, \ (1) \times a = a$.

A third property of multiplication is the Multiplication Property of Zero. This property states that any value multiplied by zero will result in zero.

The **Zero Property of Multiplication:** For any real numbers $a, \ (0) \times a = 0$.

Multiplying Rational Numbers
----------------------------

You’ve decided to make cookies for a party. The recipe you’ve chosen makes 6 dozen cookies, but you only need 2 dozen. How do you reduce the recipe?

![0](media/65.png "Figure 1: In this case, you should not use subtraction to find the new values. Subtraction means to make less by taking away. You haven’t made any cookies; therefore, you cannot take any away. Instead, you need to make $\frac{2}{6}$ or $\frac{1}{3}$ of the original recipe. This process involves multiplying fractions.")

For any real numbers $a, b, c,$ and $d$, where  $\ b  \neq 0$ and  $\ d  \neq 0$,

$$
\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd}
$$

**Example 3:** _The original cookie recipe calls for 8 cups flour. How much is needed for the reduced recipe?_

**Solution:** Begin by writing the multiplication situation. $8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}$. You need to rewrite this product in the form of the property above. In order to perform this multiplication, you need to rewrite 8 as the fraction $\frac{8}{1}$.

$$
8 \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{8}{1} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{8 \cdot 1}{1 \cdot 3} = \frac{8}{3} = 2 \frac{2}{3}
$$

You will need $2 \ \frac{2}{3}$ cups flour.

Multiplication of fractions can also be shown visually. For example, to multiply $\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{5}$, draw one model to represent the first fraction and a second model to represent the second fraction.

![0](media/66.png "Figure 2: By placing one model (divided in thirds horizontally) on top of the other (divided in fifths vertically), you divide one whole rectangle into $bd$ smaller parts. Shade $ac$ smaller regions.")

![0](media/67.png "Figure 3: The product of the two fractions is the $\frac{shaded \ regions}{total \ regions}.$")

$$
\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2}{15}
$$

**Example 4:** _Simplify_ $\frac{3}{7} \cdot \frac{4}{5}.$

![0](media/68.png "Figure 4: **Solution:** By drawing visual representations, you can see that")

$$
\frac{3}{7} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{12}{35}
$$

Multiplication Properties
-------------------------

Properties that hold true for addition such as the Associative Property and Commutative Property also hold true for multiplication. They are summarized below.

The **Associative Property of Multiplication:** For any real numbers $a, \ b,$ and $c,$

$$
(a \cdot b)\cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)
$$

The **Commutative Property of Multiplication:** For any real numbers $a$ and $b,$

$$
a(b) = b(a)
$$

The **Same Sign Multiplication Rule:** The product of two positive or two negative numbers is positive.

The **Different Sign Multiplication Rule:** The product of a positive number and a negative number is a negative number.

Solving Real-World Problems Using Multiplication
------------------------------------------------

![0](media/69.png "Figure 5: **Example 5:** _Anne has a bar of chocolate and she offers Bill a piece. Bill quickly breaks off $\frac{1}{4}$ of the bar and eats it. Another friend, Cindy, takes $\frac{1}{3}$ of what was left. Anne splits the remaining candy bar into two equal pieces, which she shares with a third friend, Dora. How much of the candy bar does each person get?_")

**Solution:** Think of the bar as one whole.

$1- \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$. This is the amount remaining after Bill takes his piece.

$\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4}$. This is the fraction Cindy receives.

$\frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$. This is the amount remaining after Cindy takes her piece.

Anne divides the remaining bar into two equal pieces. Every person receives $\frac{1}{4}$ of the bar.

**Example 6:** _Doris’s truck gets $10 \frac{2}{3}$ miles per gallon. Her tank is empty so she puts in $5 \frac{1}{2}$ gallons of gas._

_How far can she travel?_

**Solution:** Begin by writing each mixed number as an improper fraction.

$$
\begin{align*}
10 \frac{2}{3} = \frac{32}{3} && 5 \frac{1}{2} = \frac{11}{2}
\end{align*}
$$

Now multiply the two values together.

$$
\frac{32}{3} \cdot \frac{11}{2} = \frac{352}{6} = 58\frac{4}{6} = 58\frac{2}{3}
$$

Doris can travel $58 \ \frac{2}{3}$ miles on 5.5 gallons of gas.

### 2.5 The Distributive Property

<article>

![0](media/70.png "Figure 1: At the end of the school year, an elementary school teacher makes a little gift bag for each of his students. Each bag contains one class photograph, two party favors, and five pieces of candy. The teacher will distribute the bags among his 28 students. How many of each item does the teacher need?")

You could begin this problem by deciding your variables.

Let $p=photograph, \ f=favors,$ and $c=candy.$

Next you can write an expression to represent the situation: $p + 2f + 5c.$

There are 28 students in class, so the teacher needs to repeat the bag 28 times. An easier way to write this is $28 \cdot (p + 2f + 5c).$

We can omit the multiplication symbol and write $28(p + 2f + 5c)$.

Therefore, the teacher needs $28p + 28(2f) + 28(5c)$ _or_ $28p + 56f + 140c.$

The teacher needs 28 photographs, 56 favors, and 140 pieces of candy to complete the end-of-year gift bags.

When you multiply an algebraic expression by another expression, you apply the **Distributive Property.**

The **Distributive Property:** For any real expressions $M, \ N,$ and $K$:

$$
\begin{align*}
& M(N+K)= MN+MK\\
& M(N-K)= MN-MK
\end{align*}
$$

**Example 1:** _Determine the value of $11(2 + 6)$ using both Order of Operations and the Distributive Property._

**Solution:** Using the Order of Operations: $11(2 + 6) = 11(8)= 88.$

Using the Distributive Property: $11(2 + 6) = 11(2) + 11(6)= 22 + 66 = 88.$

Regardless of the method, the answer is the same.

**Example 2:** _Simplify_ $7(3x - 5).$

**Solution 1:** Think of this expression as seven groups of $(3x -5)$. You could write this expression seven times and add all the like terms. $(3x-5)+(3x-5)+(3x-5)+(3x-5)+(3x-5)+(3x-5)+(3x-5)=21x-35$

**Solution 2:** Apply the Distributive Property. $7(3x-5)= 7(3x)+7(-5)= 21x-35$

**Example 3:** _Simplify_ $\frac{2}{7} (3y^2 - 11).$

**Solution:** Apply the Distributive Property.

$$
\begin{align*}
&\frac{2}{7} (3y^2 + -11)= \frac{2}{7} (3y^2) + \frac{2}{7}(-11)\\
&\frac{6y^2}{7}-\frac{22}{7}
\end{align*}
$$

Identifying Expressions Involving the Distributive Property
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Distributive Property often appears in expressions, and many times it does not involve parentheses as grouping symbols. In Lesson 1.2, we saw how the fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol. The following example involves using the Distributive Property with fractions.

**Example 4:** _Simplify_ $\frac{2x+4}{8}.$

**Solution:** Think of the denominator as: $\frac{2x+4}{8}= \frac{1}{8} (2x+4).$

Now apply the Distributive Property: $\frac{1}{8} (2x)+ \frac{1}{8}(4) = \frac{2x}{8} + \frac{4}{8}.$

Simplify: $\frac{x}{4} + \frac{1}{2}.$

Solve Real-World Problems Using the Distributive Property
---------------------------------------------------------

The Distributive Property is one of the most common mathematical properties seen in everyday life. It crops up in business and in geometry. Anytime we have two or more groups of objects, the Distributive Property can help us solve for an unknown.

**Example 5:** _An octagonal gazebo is to be built as shown below. Building code requires five-foot-long steel supports to be added along the base and four-foot-long steel supports to be added to the roof-line of the gazebo. What length of steel will be required to complete the project?_

**Solution:** Each side will require two lengths, one of five and one of four feet respectively. There are eight sides, so here is our equation.

![0](media/71.png "Figure 2: Steel required $= 8(4 + 5)$ feet.")

We can use the Distributive Property to find the total amount of steel.

Steel required $= 8 \times 4 + 8 \times 5 = 32 + 40$ feet.

A total of 72 feet of steel is needed for this project.

### 2.6 Division of Rational Numbers

<article>

So far in this chapter, you have added, subtracted, and multiplied rational numbers. It now makes sense to learn how to divide rational numbers. We will begin with a definition of **inverse operations.**

Inverse operations "undo" each other.

For example, addition and subtraction are inverse operations because addition cancels subtraction and vice versa. The additive identity results in a sum of zero. In the same sense, multiplication and division are inverse operations. This leads into the next property: The Inverse Property of Multiplication.

**The Inverse Property of Multiplication:** For every nonzero number $a$, there is a multiplicative inverse $\frac{1}{a}$ such that $a \left ( \frac{1}{a} \right ) = 1$.

The values of $a$ and $\frac{1}{a}$ are called **reciprocals.** In general, two nonzero numbers whose product is 1 are reciprocals.

**Reciprocal:** The reciprocal of a nonzero rational number $\frac{a}{b}$ is $\frac{b}{a}$.

Note: The number zero does not have a reciprocal.

Using Reciprocals to Divide Rational Numbers
--------------------------------------------

When dividing rational numbers, use the following rule:

**“When dividing rational numbers, multiply by the ‘right’ reciprocal.”**

In this case, the “right” reciprocal means to take the reciprocal of the fraction on the right-hand side of the division operator.

**Example 1:** _Simplify_ $\frac{2}{9} \div \frac{3}{7}$.

**Solution:** Begin by multiplying by the “right” reciprocal.

$$
\frac{2}{9} \times \frac{7}{3} = \frac{14}{27}
$$

**Example 2:** _Simplify_ $\frac{7}{3} \div \frac{2}{3}$.

**Solution:** Begin by multiplying by the “right” reciprocal.

$$
\frac{7}{3} \div \frac{2}{3} = \frac{7}{3} \times \frac{3}{2} = \frac{7 \cdot 3} {2 \cdot 3} = \frac{7}{2}
$$

Instead of the division symbol $\div$, you may see a large fraction bar. This is seen in the next example.

**Example 3:** _Simplify_ $\frac{\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{7}{8}}$.

**Solution:** The fraction bar separating $\frac{2}{3}$ and $\frac{7}{8}$ indicates division.

$$
\frac{2}{3} \div \frac{7}{8}
$$

Simplify as in Example 2:

$$
\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{8}{7} = \frac{16}{21}
$$

Using Reciprocals to Solve Real-World Problems
----------------------------------------------

The need to divide rational numbers is necessary for solving problems in physics, chemistry, and manufacturing. The following example illustrates the need to divide fractions in physics.

**Example 4:** _Newton’s Second Law relates acceleration to the force of an object and its mass: $a = \frac{F}{m}$. Suppose $F = 7\frac{1}{3}$ and $m= \frac{1}{5}$. Find $a$, the acceleration._

**Solution:** Before beginning the division, the mixed number of force must be rewritten as an improper fraction.

Replace the fraction bar with a division symbol and simplify: $a = \frac{22}{3} \div \frac{1}{5}.$

$\frac{22}{3} \times \frac{5}{1} = \frac{110}{3} = 36 \frac{2}{3}$. Therefore, the acceleration is $36 \frac{2}{3} \ m/s^2.$

**Example 5:** _Anne runs a mile and a half in one-quarter hour. What is her speed in miles per hour?_

**Solution:** Use the formula $speed = \frac{distance}{time}$.

$$
s = 1.5 \div \frac{1}{4}
$$

Rewrite the expression and simplify: $s = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{1} = \frac{4 \cdot 3} {2 \cdot 1} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \ mi/hr.$

### 2.7 Square Roots and Real Numbers

<article>

![0](media/73.png "Figure 1: Human chess is a variation of chess, often played at Renaissance fairs, in which people take on the roles of the various pieces on a chessboard. The chessboard is played on a square plot of land that measures 324 square meters with the chess squares marked on the grass. How long is each side of the chessboard?")

To answer this question, you will need to know how to find the square root of a number.

The **square root** of a number $n$ is any number such that $s^2 = n$.

Every positive number has two square roots, the positive and the negative. The symbol used to represent the square root is $\sqrt{x}$. It is assumed that this is the positive square root of $x$. To show both the positive and negative values, you can use the symbol $\pm$, read “plus or minus.”

For example:

$\sqrt{81}=9$ means the positive square root of 81.

$-\sqrt{81}= -9$ means the negative square root of 81.

$\pm \sqrt{81} = \pm 9$ means the positive or negative square root of 81.

**Example 1:** _The human chessboard measures 324 square meters. How long is one side of the square?_

**Solution:** The area of a square is $s^2 = Area$. The value of _Area_ can be replaced with 324.

$$
s^2=324
$$

The value of $s$ represents the square root of 324.

$$
s= \sqrt{324}=18
$$

The chessboard is 18 meters long by 18 meters wide.

Approximating Square Roots
--------------------------

When the square root of a number is a whole number, this number is called a **perfect square.** 9 is a perfect square because $\sqrt{9}=3$.

Not all square roots are whole numbers. Many square roots are irrational numbers, meaning there is no rational number equivalent. For example, 2 is the square root of 4 because $2 \times 2 = 4$. The number 7 is the square root of 49 because $7 \times 7 = 49$. What is the square root of 5?

There is no whole number multiplied by itself to equal five, so the $\sqrt{5}$ is not a whole number. To find the value of $\sqrt{5}$, we can use estimation.

To estimate the square root of a number, look for the perfect integers **less than** and **greater than** the value, then estimate the decimal.

**Example 2:** _Estimate_ $\sqrt{5}$.

**Solution:** The perfect square below 5 is 4 and the perfect square above 5 is 9. Therefore, $4<5<9$. Therefore, $\sqrt{5}$ is between $\sqrt{4}$ and $\sqrt{9}$, or $2< \sqrt{5}<3$. Because 5 is closer to 4 than 9, the decimal is a low value. $\sqrt{5} \approx 2.2$

Identifying Irrational Numbers
------------------------------

Recall the number hierarchy from Lesson 2.1. Real numbers have two categories: rational and irrational. If a value is not a perfect square, then it is considered an **irrational number.** These numbers cannot be written as a fraction because the decimal does not end **(non-terminating)** and does not repeat a pattern **(non-repeating)**. Although irrational square roots cannot be written as fractions, we can still write them **exactly**, without typing the value into a calculator.

For example, suppose you do not have a calculator and you need to find $\sqrt{18}$. You know there is no whole number squared that equals 18, so $\sqrt{18}$ is an irrational number. The value is between $\sqrt{16}=4$ and $\sqrt{25}=5$. However, we need to find an exact value of $\sqrt{18}$.

Begin by writing the **prime factorization** of $\sqrt{18}$. $\sqrt{18} = \sqrt{9 \times 2}= \sqrt{9} \times \sqrt{2}$. The $\sqrt{9} = 3$ but $\sqrt{2}$ does not have a whole number value. Therefore, the exact value of $\sqrt{18} = 3 \sqrt{2}$.

You can check your answer in the calculator by finding the decimal approximation for each square root.

**Example 3:** _Find the exact value_ $\sqrt{75}$.

**Solution:**

$$
\sqrt{75} = \sqrt{25 \times 3} = \sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{3} = 5 \sqrt{3}
$$

Classifying Real Numbers
------------------------

**Example 4:** _Using the chart found in Lesson 2.1, categorize the following numbers:_

a) 0

b) –1

c) $\frac{\pi}{3}$

d) $\frac{\sqrt{36}}{9}$

**Solutions:**

a) Zero is a whole number, an integer, a rational number, and a real number.

b) –1 is an integer, a rational number, and a real number.

c) $\frac{\pi}{3}$ is an irrational number and a real number.

d) $\frac{\sqrt{36}}{9} = \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3}$. This is a rational number and a real number.

Graphing and Ordering Real Numbers
----------------------------------

Every real number can be positioned between two integers. Many times you will need to organize real numbers to determine the least value, greatest value, or both. This is usually done on a number line.

**Example 5:** _Plot the following rational numbers on the number line._

a) $\frac{2}{3}$

b) $-\frac{3}{7}$

c) $\frac{\pi}{2}$

d) $\frac{57}{16}$

**Solutions:**

a) $\frac{2}{3} = 0.\overline{6}$, which is between 0 and 1. ![0](media/74.png "Figure 2: b) $-\frac{3}{7}$ is between –1 and 0. ![0](media/75.png)")

\[Figure 3\]

c) $\frac{\pi}{2} \approx \frac{3.14159}{2} \approx 1.571$ ![0](media/76.png "Figure 4: d) $\frac{57}{16} = 3.5625$ ![0](media/77.png)")

### 2.8 Problem-Solving Strategies: Guess and Check and Work Backwards

<article>

This lesson will expand your toolbox of problem-solving strategies to include **guess and check** and **work backwards**. Let’s begin by reviewing the four-step problem-solving plan.

**Step 1: Understand the problem.**

**Step 2: Devise a plan – Translate.**

**Step 3: Carry out the plan – Solve.**

**Step 4: Look – Check and Interpret.**

Develop and Use the Strategy: Guess and Check
---------------------------------------------

The strategy for the “guess and check” method is to guess a solution and use that guess in the problem to see if you get the correct answer. If the answer is too big or too small, then make another guess that will get you closer to the goal. You continue guessing until you arrive at the correct solution. The process might sound like a long one; however, the guessing process will often lead you to patterns that you can use to make better guesses along the way.

Here is an example of how this strategy is used in practice.

**Example 1:** _Nadia takes a ribbon that is 48 inches long and cuts it in two pieces. One piece is three times as long as the other. How long is each piece?_

**Solution:** We need to find two numbers that add to 48. One number is three times the other number.

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{Guess} && 5 \ \text{and} \ 15 && \text{the sum is} \ 5 + 15 = 20 && \text{which is too small}\\
&\text{Guess bigger numbers} && 6 \ \text{and} \ 18 && \text{the sum is} \ 6 + 18 = 24 && \text{which is too small}
\end{align*}
$$

However, you can see that the previous answer is exactly half of 48.

Multiply 6 and 18 by two.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Our next guess is} && 12 \ \text{and} \ 36 && \text{the sum is} \ 12 + 36 = 48 && \text{This is correct}.
\end{align*}
$$

Develop and Use the Strategy: Work Backwards
--------------------------------------------

The “work backwards” method works well for problems in which a series of operations is applied to an unknown quantity and you are given the resulting value. The strategy in these problems is to start with the result and apply the operations in reverse order until you find the unknown. Let’s see how this method works by solving the following problem.

**Example 2:** _Anne has a certain amount of money in her bank account on Friday morning. During the day she writes a check for $24.50, makes an ATM withdrawal of $80, and deposits a check for $235. At the end of the day, she sees that her balance is $451.25. How much money did she have in the bank at the beginning of the day?_

**Solution:** We need to find the money in Anne’s bank account at the beginning of the day on Friday. From the unknown amount, we subtract $24.50 and $80 and we add $235. We end up with $451.25. We need to start with the result and apply the operations in reverse.

Start with $451.25. Subtract $235, add $80, and then add $24.50.

$$
451.25 - 235 + 80 + 24.50 = 320.75
$$

Anne had $320.75 in her account at the beginning of the day on Friday.

Plan and Compare Alternative Approaches to Solving Problems
-----------------------------------------------------------

Most word problems can be solved in more than one way. Often one method is more straightforward than others. In this section, you will see how different problem-solving approaches compare for solving different kinds of problems.

**Example 3:** _Nadia’s father is 36. He is 16 years older than four times Nadia’s age. How old is Nadia?_

**Solution:** This problem can be solved with either of the strategies you learned in this section. Let’s solve the problem using both strategies.

**Guess and Check Method:**

We need to find Nadia’s age.

We know that her father is 16 years older than four times her age, or $4 \times$ (Nadia’s age) + 16.

We know her father is 36 years old.

**Work Backwards Method:**

Nadia’s father is 36 years old.

To get from Nadia’s age to her father’s age, we multiply Nadia’s age by four and add 16.

Working backward means we start with the father’s age, subtract 16, and divide by 4.

Solve Real-World Problems Using Selected Strategies as Part of a Plan
---------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 4:** _Hana rents a car for a day. Her car rental company charges $50 per day and $0.40 per mile. Peter rents a car from a different company that charges $70 per day and $0.30 per mile. How many miles do they have to drive before Hana and Peter pay the same price for the rental for the same number of miles?_

**Solution:** Hana’s total cost is $50 plus $0.40 times the number of miles.

Peter’s total cost is $70 plus $0.30 times the number of miles.

Guess the number of miles and use this guess to calculate Hana’s and Peter’s total cost.

Keep guessing until their total cost is the same.

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{Guess} && 50 \ miles\\
&\text{Check} && \$50+\$0.40(50)=\$70 && \$70+\$0.30(50)=\$85 \\
&\text{Guess} && 60 \ miles\\
&\text{Check} && \$50+\$0.40(60)=\$74 && \$70+\$0.30(60)=\$88
\end{align*}
$$

Notice that for an increase of 10 miles, the difference between total costs fell from $15 to $14. To get the difference to zero, we should try increasing the mileage by 140 miles.

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{Guess} && 200 \ miles\\
&\text{Check} && \$50+\$0.40(200)=\$130 && \$70+\$0.30(200)=\$130 && \text{correct}
\end{align*}
$$

## 3.0 Linear Equations

<article>

Aside from simplifying algebraic expressions and graphing functions, solving equations is one of the most important concepts in mathematics. To successfully manipulate an equation, you must understand and be able to apply the rules of mathematics.

![0](media/79.png "Figure 1: Mathematical equations are used in many different career fields. Medical researchers use equations to determine the length of time it takes for a drug to circulate throughout the body, botanists use equations to determine the amount of time it takes a Sequoia tree to reach a particular height, and environmental scientists can use equations to approximate the number of years it will take to repopulate the bison species.")

### 3.1 One-Step Equations

<article>

It’s Easier than You Think
--------------------------

You have been solving equations since the beginning of this textbook, although you may not have recognized it. For example, in Lesson 1.4, you determined the answer to the pizza problem below.

$20.00 _was one-quarter of the money spent on pizza._

$\frac{1}{4} m=20.00$ What divided by 4 equals 20.00?

The solution is 80. So, the amount of money spent on pizza was $80.00.

By working through this question mentally, you were applying mathematical rules and solving for the variable $m$.

**Definition:** To **solve** an equation means to write an equivalent equation that has the variable by itself on one side. This is also known as **isolating the variable.**

In order to begin solving equations, you must understand three basic concepts of algebra: inverse operations, equivalent equations, and the Addition Property of Equality.

Inverse Operations and Equivalent Equations
-------------------------------------------

In Lesson 1.2, you learned how to simplify an expression using the Order of Operations: **P**arentheses, **E**xponents, **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision completed in order from left to right, and **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (also completed from left to right). Each of these operations has an **inverse.** Inverse operations “undo” each other when combined.

For example, the inverse of addition is subtraction. The inverse of an exponent is a root.

**Example 1:** _Determine the inverse of division._

**Solution:** To undo dividing something, you would multiply.

By applying the same inverse operations to each side of an equation, you create an **equivalent equation**.

**Definition: Equivalent equations** are two or more equations having the same solution.

The Addition Property of Equality
---------------------------------

Just like Spanish, chemistry, or even music, mathematics has a set of rules you must follow in order to be successful. These rules are called properties, theorems, or axioms. They have been proven or agreed upon years ago, so you can apply them to many different situations.

For example, the **Addition Property of Equality** allows you to apply the same operation to each side of the equation, or “what you do to one side of an equation you can do to the other.”

**The Addition Property of Equality**

For all real numbers $a, b,$ and $c$:

If $a = b$, then $a + c = b + c$.

Solving One-Step Equations Using Addition or Subtraction
--------------------------------------------------------

Because subtraction can be considered “adding a negative,” the Addition Property of Equality also works if you need to subtract the same value from each side of an equation.

**Example 2:**

_Solve for_ $y$_:_ $16 = y-11$.

**Solution:** When asked to solve for $y$, your goal is to write an equivalent equation with the variable $y$ isolated on one side.

Write the original equation $16 = y-11$.

Apply the Addition Property of Equality $16 + 11 = y - 11 + 11$

Simplify by adding like terms $27 = y$.

The solution is $y = 27$.

**Example 3:** _One method to weigh a horse is to load it into an empty trailer with a known weight and reweigh the trailer. A Shetland pony is loaded onto a trailer that weighs 2,200 pounds empty. The trailer is then reweighed. The new weight is 2,550 pounds. How much does the pony weigh?_

**Solution:** Choose a variable to represent the weight of the pony, say $p$.

Write an equation $2550 = 2200 + p$.

Apply the Addition Property of Equality $2550 - 2200 = 2200 + p - 2200.$

Simplify $350 = p$.

The Shetland pony weighs 350 pounds.

Equations that take one step to isolate the variable are called **one-step equations**. Such equations can also involve multiplication or division.

Solving One-Step Equations Using Multiplication or Division
-----------------------------------------------------------

**The Multiplication Property of Equality**

For all real numbers $a, b$, and $c$:

_If_ $a = b$, _then_ $a(c)= b(c).$

**Example 4:**

_Solve for_ $k: -8k= -96.$

**Solution:** Because $-8k= -8  \times k$, the inverse operation of multiplication is division. Therefore, we must cancel multiplication by applying the Multiplication Property of Equality.

Write the original equation $-8k= -96$.

Apply the Multiplication Property of Equality $-8k \div -8 = -96 \div -8.$

The solution is $k= 12$.

When working with fractions, you must remember: $\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{b}{a} = 1$. In other words, in order to cancel a fraction using division, you really must multiply by its reciprocal.

**Example 5:** _Solve_ $\frac{1}{8} \cdot x = 1.5$.

The variable $x$ is being multiplied by one-eighth. Instead of dividing two fractions, we multiply by the reciprocal of $\frac{1}{8}$, which is 8.

$$
\begin{align*}
\cancel{8} \left (\frac{1}{\cancel{8}} \cdot x \right ) & = 8(1.5) \\
x & = 12
\end{align*}
$$

Solving Real-World Problems Using Equations
-------------------------------------------

As was mentioned in the chapter opener, many careers base their work on manipulating linear equations. Consider the botanist studying bamboo as a renewable resource. She knows bamboo can grow up to 60 centimeters per day. If the specimen she measured was 1 meter tall, how long would it take to reach 5 meters in height? By writing and solving this equation, she will know exactly how long it should take for the bamboo to reach the desired height.

**Example 6:** In good weather, tomato seeds can grow into plants and bear ripe fruit in as few as 19 weeks. Lorna planted her seeds 11 weeks ago. How long must she wait before her tomatoes are ready to be picked?

**Solution:** The variable in question is the number of weeks until the tomatoes are ready. Call this variable $w$.

Write an equation $w + 11 = 19.$

Solve for $w$ by using the Addition Property of Equality.

$$
\begin{align*}
w + 11 - 11 & = 19 - 11 \\
w & =8
\end{align*}
$$

![0](media/82.png "Figure 1: It will take as few as 8 weeks for the plant to bear ripe fruit.")

**Example 7:** _In 2004, Takeru Kobayashi of Nagano, Japan, ate_ $53 \frac{1}{2}$ _hot dogs in 12 minutes. He broke his previous world record, set in 2002, by three more hot dogs. Calculate:_

a) How many minutes it took him to eat one hot dog.

b) How many hot dogs he ate per minute.

c) What his old record was.

**Solution:**

a) Write an equation, letting $m$ represent the number of minutes to eat one hot dog. Then, $53.5m = 12$

Applying the Multiplication Property of Equality,

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{53.5m}{53.5} & = \frac{12}{53.5} \\
m & = 0.224\ minutes
\end{align*}
$$

It took approximately 0.224 minutes or 13.44 seconds to eat one hot dog.

Questions b) and c) are left for you to complete in the exercises.

### 3.2 Two-Step Equations

<article>

Suppose Shaun weighs 146 pounds and wants to lose enough weight to wrestle in the 130-pound class. His nutritionist designed a diet for Shaun so he will lose about 2 pounds per week. How many weeks will it take Shaun to weigh enough to wrestle in his class?

This is an example that can be solved by working backward (Lesson 2.8). In fact, you may have already found the answer by using this method. _The solution is 8 weeks_.

By translating this situation into an algebraic sentence, we can begin the process of **solving equations**. To solve an equation means to “undo” all the operations of the sentence, leaving a value for the variable.

Translate Shaun’s situation into an equation.

$$
-2w + 146 = 130
$$

This sentence has two operations: addition and multiplication. To find the value of the variable, we must use both properties of Equality: the Addition Property of Equality and the Multiplication Property of Equality.

**Procedure to Solve Equations of the Form** $ax + b =$ **_some number:_**

1. Use the Addition Property of Equality to get the variable term $ax$ alone on one side of the equation:

$$
ax = some\ number
$$

2. Use the Multiplication Property of Equality to get the variable $x$ alone on one side of the equation:

$$
x = some\ number
$$

**Example 1:** _Solve Shaun’s problem._

**Solution:** $-2 w + 146 = 130$

Apply the Addition Property of Equality: $-2w + 146 - 146 = 130-146.$

Simplify: $-2w = -16.$

Apply the Multiplication Property of Equality: $-2w \div -2 = -16 \div -2.$

The solution is $w = 8$.

It will take 8 weeks for Shaun to weigh 130 pounds.

Solving Equations by Combining Like Terms
-----------------------------------------

Michigan has a 6% sales tax. Suppose you made a purchase and paid $95.12, including tax. How much was the purchase before tax?

Begin by determining the noun that is unknown and choose a letter as its representation.

The purchase price is unknown so this is our variable. Call it $p$. Now translate the sentence into an algebraic equation.

$$
\begin{align*}
price + (0.06) price & = total\ amount \\
p + 0.06p & = 95.12
\end{align*}
$$

To solve this equation, you must know how to **combine like terms.**

**Like terms** are expressions that have **identical** variable parts.

According to this definition, you can only combine like terms if they are identical. **Combining like terms only applies to addition and subtraction!** This is not a true statement when referring to multiplication and division.

The numerical part of an algebraic term is called the **coefficient**. To combine like terms, you add (or subtract) the coefficients of the identical variable parts.

**Example 2:** _Identify the like terms, then combine._

$$
10b + 7bc + 4c + (-8b)
$$

**Solution:** Like terms have identical variable parts. The only terms having identical variable parts are $10b$ and $-8b$. To combine these like terms, add them together.

$$
10b + 7bc + 4c + -8b = 2b + 7bc + 4c
$$

You will now apply this concept to the Michigan sales tax situation.

**Example 3:** _What was the purchase amount from this section's opening scenario?_

**Solution:** $p + 0.06p = 95.12$

Combine the like terms: $p + 0.06p = 1.06p$, since $p = 1p.$

Simplify: $1.06p = 95.12.$

Apply the Multiplication Property of Equality: $1.06p \div 1.06 = 95.12 \div 1.06.$

Simplify: $p = 89.74.$

The price before tax was $89.74.

The next several examples show how algebraic equations can be created to solve real-world situations.

![0](media/83.png "Figure 1: **Example 4:** _An emergency plumber charges_ $65 _as a call-out fee plus an additional_ $75 per hour. He arrives at a house at 9:30 and works to repair a water tank. If the total repair bill is $196.25, at what time was the repair completed?")

**Solution:** Translate the sentence into an equation. The number of hours it took to complete the job is unknown, so call it $h$.

Write the equation: $65 + 75(h) = 196.25.$

Apply the Addition Property and simplify.

$$
65 + 75(h)-65 = 196.25-65
$$

$$
75(h)=131.25
$$

Apply the Multiplication Property of Equality: $75(h)\div 75 = 131.25 \div 75.$

Simplify: $h = 1.75.$

The plumber worked for 1.75 hours, or 1 hour, 45 minutes. Since he started at 9:30, the repair was completed at 11:15.

**Example 5:** _To determine the temperature in Fahrenheit, multiply the Celsius temperature by 1.8 then add 32. Determine the Celsius temperature if it is_ $89^\circ F$.

**Solution:** Translate the sentence into an equation. The temperature in Celsius is unknown; call it $C$.

Write the equation: $1.8C + 32 = 89.$

Apply the Addition Property and simplify.

$$
\begin{align*}
1.8C + 32 - 32 & = 89 - 32 \\
1.8C & = 57
\end{align*}
$$

Apply the Multiplication Property of Equality: $1.8C \div 1.8 = 57 \div 1.8.$

Simplify: $C = 31.67.$

If the temperature is $89^\circ F$, then it is $31.67^\circ C$.

### 3.3 Multi-Step Equations

<article>

So far in this chapter you have learned how to solve one-step equations of the form $y=ax$ and two-step equations of the form $y = ax+b$. This lesson will expand upon solving equations to include solving multi-step equations and equations involving the Distributive Property.

Solving Multi-Step Equations by Combining Like Terms
----------------------------------------------------

In the last lesson, you learned the definition of like terms and how to combine such terms. We will use the following situation to further demonstrate solving equations involving like terms.

You are hosting a Halloween party. You will need to provide 3 cans of soda per person, 4 slices of pizza per person, and 37 party favors. You have a total of 79 items. How many people are coming to your party?

This situation has several pieces of information: soda cans, slices of pizza, and party favors. Translate this into an algebraic equation.

$$
3p + 4p + 37 = 79
$$

This equation requires three steps to solve. In general, to solve any equation you should follow this procedure.

**Procedure to Solve Equations:**

1. Remove any parentheses by using the Distributive Property or the Multiplication Property of Equality.

2. Simplify each side of the equation by combining like terms.

3. Isolate the $ax$ term. Use the Addition Property of Equality to get the variable on one side of the equal sign and the numerical values on the other.

4. Isolate the variable. Use the Multiplication Property of Equality to get the variable alone on one side of the equation.

5. Check your solution.

**Example 1:** _Determine the number of party-goers in the opening example._

**Solution:** $3p + 4p + 37 = 79$

Combine like terms: $7p+37=79.$

Apply the Addition Property of Equality: $7p+37-37=79-37.$

Simplify: $7p=42.$

Apply the Multiplication Property of Equality: $7p \div 7=42 \div 7.$

The solution is $p=6$.

There are six people coming to the party.

Solving Multi-Step Equations by Using the Distributive Property
---------------------------------------------------------------

When faced with an equation such as $2(5x+9)=78$, the first step is to remove the parentheses. There are two options to remove the parentheses. You can apply the Distributive Property or you can apply the Multiplication Property of Equality. This lesson will show you how to use the Distributive Property to solve multi-step equations.

**Example 2:** _Solve for_ $x$_:_ $2(5x+9)=78.$

**Solution:** Apply the Distributive Property: $10x+18=78.$

Apply the Addition Property of Equality: $10x+18-18=78-18.$

Simplify: $10x=60.$

Apply the Multiplication Property of Equality: $10x \div 10 = 60 \div 10.$

The solution is $x=6$.

Check: Does $10(6) + 18 = 78?$ Yes, so the answer is correct.

**Example 3:** _Kashmir needs to fence in his puppy. He will fence in three sides, connecting it to his back porch. He wants the run to be 12 feet long and he has 40 feet of fencing. How wide can Kashmir make his puppy enclosure?_

**Solution:** Translate the sentence into an algebraic equation. Let $w$ represent the width of the enclosure.

$$
w + w + 12 = 40
$$

Solve for $w$.

$$
\begin{align*}
2w + 12 & = 40 \\
2w + 12 - 12 & = 40-12 \\
2w & = 28 \\
2w \div 2 & = 28 \div 2 \\
w & = 14
\end{align*}
$$

The dimensions of the enclosure are 14 feet wide by 12 feet long.

### 3.4 Equations with Variables on Both Sides

<article>

As you may now notice, equations come in all sizes and styles. There are single-step, double-step, and multi-step equations. In this lesson, you will learn how to solve equations with a variable appearing on each side of the equation. The process you need to solve this type of equation is similar to solving a multi-step equation. The procedure is repeated here.

**Procedure to Solve Equations:**

1. Remove any parentheses by using the Distributive Property or the Multiplication Property of Equality.

2. Simplify each side of the equation by combining like terms.

3. Isolate the $ax$ term. Use the Addition Property of Equality to get the variable on one side of the equal sign and the numerical values on the other.

4. Isolate the variable. Use the Multiplication Property of Equality to get the variable alone on one side of the equation.

5. Check your solution.

![0](media/85.png "Figure 1: Karen and Sarah have bank accounts. Karen has a starting balance of $125.00 and is depositing $20 each week. Sarah has a starting balance of $43 and is depositing $37 each week. When will the girls have the same amount of money?")

To solve this problem, you could use the “guess and check” method. You are looking for a particular week in which the bank accounts are equal. This could take a long time! You could also translate the sentence into an equation. The number of weeks is unknown so this is our variable, call it $w$. Now translate this situation into an algebraic equation:

$$
125 + 20w =43 + 37w
$$

This is a situation in which the variable $w$ appears on both sides of the equation. To begin to solve for the unknown, we must use the Addition Property of Equality to gather the variables on one side of the equation.

**Example 1:** _Determine when Sarah and Karen will have the same amount of money._

**Solution:** Using the Addition Property of Equality, move the variables to one side of the equation:

$$
125+20w-20w=43+37w-20w
$$

Simplify: $125=43+17w$

Solve using the steps from Lesson 3.3.

$$
\begin{align*}
125-43 & =43-43+17w \\
82 & =17w \\
82 \div 17 & =17w \div 17 \\
w & \approx 4.82
\end{align*}
$$

It will take about 4.8 weeks for Sarah and Karen to have equal amounts of money.

**Example 2:** _Solve for_ $h:3(h+1)= 11h-23.$

**Solution:** First you must remove the parentheses by using the Distributive Property.

$$
3h+3= 11h-23
$$

Gather the variables on one side.

$$
3h-3h+3= 11h-3h-23
$$

Simplify.

$$
3=8h-23
$$

Solve using the steps from Lesson 3.3.

$$
\begin{align*}
3+23 & =8h-23+23 \\
26 & =8h \\
26 \div 8 & = 8h \div 8 \\
h & = \frac{13}{4} =3.25
\end{align*}
$$

### 3.5 Ratios and Proportions

<article>

**Ratios** and **proportions** have a fundamental place in mathematics. They are used in geometry, size changes, and trigonometry. This lesson expands upon the idea of fractions to include ratios and proportions.

A **ratio** is a fraction comparing two things with the same units.

A **rate** is a fraction comparing two things with different units.

You have experienced rates many times: 65 _mi_/_hour_, $1.99/_pound_, $3.79/$yd^2$. You have also experienced ratios. A “student to teacher” ratio shows approximately how many students one teacher is responsible for in a school.

**Example 1:** _The State Dining Room in the White House measures approximately 48 feet long by 36 feet wide. Compare the length of the room to the width, and express your answer as a ratio._

**Solution:**

$$
\frac{48\ feet}{36\ feet} = \frac{4}{3}
$$

The length of the State Dining Room is $\frac{4}{3}$ the width.

A **proportion** is a statement in which two fractions are equal: $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$.

**Example 2:** _Is_ $\frac{2}{3} = \frac{6}{12}$ _a proportion?_

**Solution:** Find the least common multiple of 3 and 12 to create a common denominator.

$$
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{12} \neq \frac{6}{12}
$$

This is NOT a proportion because these two fractions are not equal.

A ratio can also be written using a colon instead of the fraction bar.

$\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$ can also be read, “$a$ is to $b$ as $c$ is to $d$” or $a:b = c:d.$

The values of $a$ and $d$ are called the **extremes** of the proportion and the values of $b$ and $c$ are called the **means**. To solve a proportion, you can use the **cross products**.

The **Cross Products of a Proportion:**

If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $ad=bc$.

**Example 3:** _Solve_ $\frac{a}{9} = \frac{7}{6}$.

**Solution:** Apply the Cross Products of a Proportion.

$$
\begin{align*}
6a & =7(9) \\
6a & =63
\end{align*}
$$

Solve for $a$.

$$
a=10.5
$$

![0](media/86.png "Figure 1: Consider the following situation: _A train travels at a steady speed. It covers 15 miles in 20 minutes. How far will it travel in 7 hours, assuming it continues at the same rate?_ This is an example of a problem that can be solved using several methods, including proportions.")

To solve using a proportion, you need to translate the statement into an algebraic sentence. The key to writing correct proportions is to keep the units the same in each fraction.

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{miles}{time} = \frac{miles}{time} && \frac{miles}{time} \neq \frac{time}{miles}
\end{align*}
$$

You will be asked to solve this problem in the practice set.

### 3.6 Scale and Indirect Measurement

<article>

We are occasionally faced with having to make measurements of things that would be difficult to measure directly: the height of a tall tree, the width of a wide river, the height of the moon’s craters, even the distance between two cities separated by mountainous terrain. In such circumstances, measurements can be made **indirectly**, using proportions and similar triangles. Such indirect methods link measurement with geometry and numbers. In this lesson, we will examine some of the methods for making indirect measurements.

![0](media/87.png "Figure 1: A map is a two-dimensional, geometrically accurate representation of a section of the Earth’s surface. Maps are used to show, pictorially, how various geographical features are arranged in a particular area. The **scale** of the map describes the relationship between distances on a map and the corresponding distances on the earth's surface. These measurements are expressed as a fraction or a ratio.")

In the last lesson, you learned the different ways to write a ratio: using the fraction bar, using a colon, and in words. Outside of mathematics books, ratios are often written as two numbers separated by a colon (:). Here is a table that compares ratios written in two different ways.

| **Ratio** | **Is Read As** | **Equivalent To** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1:20 | one to twenty | $\left (\frac{1}{20} \right )$ |
| 2:3 | two to three | $\left (\frac{2}{3} \right )$ |
| 1:1000 | one to one-thousand | $\left (\frac{1}{1000} \right )$ |

If a map had a scale of 1:1000 (“one to one-thousand”), one unit of measurement on the map (1 inch or 1 centimeter, for example) would represent 1000 of the same units on the ground. A 1:1 (one to one) map would be a map as large as the area it shows!

![0](media/88.png "Figure 2: **Example :** _Anne is visiting a friend in London and is using the map above to navigate from Fleet Street to Borough Road. She is using a 1:100,000 scale map, where 1 cm on the map represents 1 km in real life. Using a ruler, she measures the distance on the map as 8.8 cm. How far is the real distance from the start of her journey to the end?_")

The scale is the ratio of distance on the map to the corresponding distance in real life and can be written as a proportion.

$$
\frac{\text{dist.on map}}{\text{real dist.}} = \frac{1}{100, 000}
$$

By substituting known values, the proportion becomes:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{8.8 \ cm}{\text{real dist.} (x)} & = \frac{1}{100,000} && \text{Cross multiply}. \\
880000 \ cm & = x && 100 \ cm = 1\ m. \\
x & = 8800 \ m && 1000 \ m = 1\ km.
\end{align*}
$$

The distance from Fleet Street to Borough Road is $8800\ m$ or $8.8\ km$.

We could, in this case, use our intuition: the $1 \ cm = 1 \ km$ scale indicates that we could simply use our reading in centimeters to give us our reading in km. Not all maps have a scale this simple. In general, you will need to refer to the map scale to convert between measurements on the map and distances in real life!

**Example 1:** _Oscar is trying to make a scale drawing of the Titanic, which he knows was 883 feet long. He would like his drawing to be 1:500 scale. How long, in inches, must his sheet of paper be?_

**Solution:** We can reason that since the scale is 1:500 that the paper must be $\frac{883}{500} = 1.766\ feet$ long. Converting to inches gives the length at $12 (1.766) \ in = 21.192 \ in$.

The paper should be at least 22 _inches_ long.

Not everything has a scale. Architecture such as the St. Louis Arch, St. Basil’s Cathedral, or the Eiffel Tower does not have a scale written on the side. It may be necessary to measure such buildings. To do so requires knowledge of similar figures and a method called **indirect measurement**.

**Similar figures** are often used to make indirect measurements. Two shapes are said to be **similar** if they are the same shape and “in proportion.” The ratio of every measurable length in one figure to the corresponding length in the other is the same. **Similar triangles** are often used in indirect measurement.

![0](media/89.png "Figure 3: Anatole is visiting Paris, and wants to know the height of the Eiffel Tower. Since he's unable to speak French, he decides to measure it in three steps.")

1.  He measures out a point 500 meters from the base of the tower, and places a small mirror flat on the ground.
2.  He stands behind the mirror in such a spot that standing upright he sees the top of the tower reflected in the mirror.
3.  He measures both the distance from the spot where he stands to the mirror (2.75 meters) and the height of his eyes from the ground (1.8 meters).

_Explain how Anatole is able to determine the height of the Eiffel Tower from these numbers and determine what that height is._

First, we will draw and label a scale diagram of the situation.

![0](media/90.png "Figure 4: The Law of Reflection states, “The angle at which the light reflects off the mirror is the same as the angle at which it hits the mirror.” Using this principle and the figure above, you can conclude that these triangles are similar with proportional sides.")

This means that the ratio of the long leg in the large triangle to the length of the long leg in the small triangle is the **same ratio** as the length of the short leg in the large triangle to the length of the short leg in the small triangle.

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{500 \ m}{2.75 \ m} & = \frac{x}{1.8 \ m} \\ 
1.8 \cdot \frac{500}{2.75} & = \frac{x}{1.8} \cdot 1.8 \\
327.3 & \approx x
\end{align*}
$$

The Eiffel Tower, according to this calculation, is approximately 327.3 meters high.

**Example 2:** _Bernard is looking at a lighthouse and wondering how high it is. He notices that it casts a long shadow, which he measures at 200 meters long. At the same time, he measures his own shadow at 3.1 meters long. Bernard is 1.9 meters tall. How tall is the lighthouse?_

![0](media/91.png "Figure 5: **Solution:** Begin by drawing a scale diagram.")

You can see there are two right triangles. The angle at which the sun causes the shadow from the lighthouse to fall is the same angle at which Bernard’s shadow falls. We have two similar triangles, so we can again say that the ratio of the corresponding sides is the same.

![0](media/92.png "Figure 6: $$")
\begin{align*}
\frac{200 \ m}{3.1 \ m} & = \frac{x}{1.9 \ m} \\
1.9 \cdot \frac{200 \ m}{3.1 \ m} & = \frac{x}{1.9 \ m} \cdot 1.9 \\
122.6 & \approx x
\end{align*}
$$

The lighthouse is approximately 122.6 meters tall.

### 3.7 Percent Problems

<article>

A **percent** is a ratio whose denominator is 100. Before we can use percent to solve problems, let's review how to convert percents to decimals and fractions and vice versa.

To convert a decimal to a percent, multiply the decimal by 100.

**Example:** Convert 0.3786 to a percent.

$$
0.3786 \times 100=37.86\%
$$

To convert a percentage to a decimal, divide the percentage by 100.

**Example:** Convert 98.6% into a decimal.

$$
98.6 \div 100 = 0.986
$$

When converting fractions to percent, we can substitute $\frac{x}{100}$ for $x\%$, where $x$ is the unknown.

**Example:** _Express_ $\frac{3}{5}$ _as a percent._

We start by representing the unknown as $x\%$ or $\frac{x}{100}$.

$$
\begin{align*}
\left (\frac{3}{5} \right)  & = \frac{x}{100} && \text{Cross multiply}. \\
5x & = 100 \cdot 3 \\
5x & = 300 \\
x & = \frac{300}{5} = 60 && \text{Divide both sides by}\ 5\ \text{to solve for}\ x. \\
\left (\frac{3}{5} \right)  & = 60\%
\end{align*}
$$

Now that you remember how to convert between decimals and percents, you are ready for the Percent Equation.

The Percent Equation
--------------------

$$
part = \% \ rate \times base
$$

The key words in a percent equation will help you translate it into a correct algebraic equation. Remember the equal sign symbolizes the word **“is”** and the multiplication symbol symbolizes the word **“of.”**

**Example 1:** _Find_ 30% _of_ 85.

**Solution:** You are asked to find the part of 85 that is 30%. First, translate into an equation.

$$
n=30. \times 85
$$

Convert the percent to a decimal and simplify.

$$
\begin{align*}
n & =0.30 \times 85 \\
n & =25.5
\end{align*}
$$

**Example 2:** _50 is 15% of what number?_

**Solution:** Translate into an equation.

$$
50 = 15. \times w
$$

Rewrite the percent as a decimal and solve.

$$
\begin{align*}
50 & = 0.15 \times w \\
\frac{50}{0.15} & = \frac{0.15 \times w}{0.15} \\
333 \frac{1}{3} & = w
\end{align*}
$$

A useful way to express changes in quantities is through percent. You have probably seen signs such as “20% more free,” or “save 35% today.” When we use percent to represent a change, we generally use the formula:

$$
\text{Percent change} = \left (\frac{\text{final amount - original amount}}{\text{original amount}}  \right ) \times 100\%
$$

A **positive** percent change would thus be an **increase**, while a **negative** change would be a **decrease.**

**Example 3:** _A school of 500 students is expecting a 20% increase in students next year. How many students will the school have?_

**Solution:** Using the percent of change equation, translate the situation into an equation. Because the 20% is an increase, it is written as a positive value.

$$
\text{Percent change} = \left (\frac{\text{final amount - original amount}}{\text{original amount}}  \right ) \times 100\%
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
20. & = \left (\frac{\text{final amount} - 500}{500} \right ) \times 100. && \text{Divide both sides by}\ 100. .\\
& && \text{Let}\ x = \text{final amount}. \\
0.2 & = \frac{x - 500}{500} && \text{Multiply both sides by}\ 500. \\
100 & = x - 500 && \text{Add}\ 500\ \text{to both sides}. \\
600 & = x
\end{align*}
$$

The school will have 600 students next year.

**Example 4:** _A $150 mp3 player is on sale for 30% off. What is the price of the player?_

**Solution:** Using the percent of change equation, translate the situation into an equation. Because the 30% is a discount, it is written as a negative.

$$
\text{Percent change} = \left (\frac{\text{final amount - original amount}}{\text{original amount}}  \right ) \times 100\%
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
\left (\frac{x- 150} {150} \right ) \cdot 100. & = - 30. && \text{Divide both sides by}\ 100\%. \\
\left (\frac{x - 150}{150} \right )  &= -0.3. && \text{Multiply both sides by}\ 150. \\
x - 150  = 150 (-0.3) &= -45 && \text{Add}\ 150\ \text{to both sides}. \\
x & = -45 + 150 \\
x & = 105
\end{align*}
$$

The mp3 player will cost $105.

Many real situations involve percents. Consider the following.

In 2004, the **US Department of Agriculture** had 112,071 employees, of which 87,846 were Caucasian. Of the remaining minorities, African-American and Hispanic employees had the two largest demographic groups, with 11,754 and 6899 employees respectively.$^*$

a) Calculate the total percentage of minority (non-Caucasian) employees at the USDA.

b) Calculate the percentage of African-American employees at the USDA.

c) Calculate the percentage of minority employees at the USDA who were neither African-American nor Hispanic.

a) Use the percent equation $\text{Rate} \times \text{Total} = \text{Part}$. The **_total_** number of employees is 112,071. We know that the number of Caucasian employees is 87,846, which means that there must be $(112,071 - 87,846) = 24,225$ non-Caucasian employees. This is the **_part_**.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Rate} \times 112,071 & = 24,225 && \text{Divide both sides by}\ 112,071. \\
\text{Rate} & \approx 0.216 && \text{Multiply by}\ 100 \ \text{to obtain percent}. \\
\text{Rate} & \approx 21.6\%
\end{align*}
$$

Approximately 21.6% of USDA employees in 2004 were from minority groups.

b) $\text{Total} = 112,071 \ \text{Part} = 11,754$

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Rate} \times 112,071 & = 11,754 && \text{Divide both sides by}\ 112,071. \\
\text{Rate} & \approx 0.105 && \text{Multiply by}\ 100 \ \text{to obtain percent}. \\
\text{Rate} & \approx 10.5\%
\end{align*}
$$

Approximately 10.5% of USDA employees in 2004 were African-American.

c) We now know there are 24,225 non-Caucasian employees. That means there must be $(24,225 - 11,754 - 6899) = 5572$ minority employees who are neither African-American nor Hispanic. The part is 5572.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Rate} \times 112,071 & = 5572 && \text{Divide both sides by}\ 112,071. \\
\text{Rate} & \approx 0.05 && \text{Multiply by}\ 100 \ \text{to obtain percent}. \\
\text{Rate} & \approx 5\%
\end{align*}
$$

Approximately 5% of USDA minority employees in 2004 were neither African-American nor Hispanic.

### 3.8 Problem-Solving Strategies: Use a Formula

<article>

Some problems are easily solved by applying a formula, such as the Percent Equation or the area of a circle. In this lesson, you will include using formulas in your toolbox of problem-solving strategies.

_An architect is designing a room that is going to be twice as long as it is wide. The total square footage of the room is going to be_ 722 _square feet. What are the dimensions in feet of the room?_

![0](media/95.png "Figure 1: This situation applies very well to a formula. The formula for the area of a rectangle is: $A=l(w)$, where $l=$ _length_ and $w=$ _width_. From the situation, we know the length is twice as long as the width. Translating this into an algebraic equation, we get:")

$$
A=(2w)w
$$

Simplifying the equation: $A=2w^2$

Substituting the known value for $A$: $722=2w^2$

$$
\begin{align*}
2w^2 & = 722 && \text{Divide both sides by} \ 2. \\
w^2 & = 361 && \text{Take the square root of both sides}. \\ 
w & = \sqrt{361} = 19 \\
2w & = 2 \times 19 = 38 \\
w  & = 19
\end{align*}
$$

The width is 19 feet and the length is 38 feet.

## 4.0 Graphing Linear Equations and Functions

<article>

The ability to graph linear equations and functions is important in mathematics. In fact, graphing equations and solving equations are two of the most important concepts in mathematics. If you master these, all mathematical subjects will be much easier, even Calculus!

This chapter focuses on the visual representations of linear equations. You will learn how to graph lines from equations and write functions of graphed lines. You will also learn how to find the slope of a line and how to use a slope to interpret a graph.

Weather, such as temperature and the distance of a thunderstorm can be predicted using linear equations. You will learn about these applications and more in this chapter.

### 4.1 The Coordinate Plane

<article>

In Lesson 1.6, you graphed ordered pairs. This lesson will expand upon your knowledge of graphing ordered pairs to include vocabulary and naming of specific items related to ordered pairs.

An ordered pair is also called a **coordinate**. The $y-$value is called the ordinate and the $x-$value is called the abscissa.

A two-dimensional (2-D) coordinate has the form $(x,y)$.

The 2-D plane that is used to graph coordinates or equations is called a **Cartesian plane** or a coordinate plane. This 2-D plane is named after its creator, Rene Descartes. The Cartesian plane is separated into four **quadrants** by two **axes**. The horizontal axis is called the **$x-$axis** and the vertical axis is called the **$y-$axis**. The quadrants are named using Roman Numerals. The image below illustrates the quadrant names.

![0](media/97.png "Figure 1: The first value of the ordered pair is the **_$x-$value_**. This value moves along the $x-$axis (horizontally). The second value of the ordered pair is the **_$y-$value_**. This value moves along the $y-$axis (vertically). This ordered pair provides the direction of the coordinate.")

**_Multimedia Link:_** For more information on the Cartesian plane and how to graph ordered pairs, visit Purple Math’s - http://www.purplemath.com/modules/plane.htm - website.

**Example 1:** Find the coordinates of points $Q$ and $R$.

![0](media/98.png "Figure 2: **Solution:** In order to get to $Q$, we move three units to the right, in the positive $x$ direction, then two units down, in the **negative** $y$ direction. The $x$ coordinate of $Q$ is +3; the $y$ coordinate of $Q$ is –2.")

$$
Q=(3,-2)
$$

The coordinates of $R$ are found in a similar way. The $x-$coordinate is +5 (five units in the positive $x$ direction). The $y-$coordinate is –2 (two units in the negative $y$ direction).

$$
R=(5,-2).
$$

Words of Wisdom from the Graphing Plane
---------------------------------------

Not all axes will be labeled for you. There will be many times you are required to label your own axes. Some problems may require you to graph only the first quadrant. Others need two or all four quadrants. The tic marks do not always count by ones. They can be marked in increments of 2, 5, or even $\frac{1}{2}$. The axes do not even need to have the same increments! The Cartesian plane below shows an example of this.

The increments by which you count your axes should MAXIMIZE the clarity of the graph.

![0](media/99.png "Figure 3: In Lesson 1.6, you learned the vocabulary words **relation, function, domain,** and **range.**")

A **relation** is a set of ordered pairs.

A **function** is a relation in which every $x-$coordinate matches with exactly one $y-$coordinate.

The set of all possible $x-$coordinates is the **domain.**

The set of all possible $y-$coordinates is called the **range.**

Graphing Given Tables and Rules
-------------------------------

If you kept track of the amount of money you earned for different hours of babysitting, you created a relation. You can graph the information in this table to visualize the relationship between these two variables.

![0](media/100.png "Figure 4: $$")
\begin{align*}
& \text{Hours} && 4 && 5 && 10 && 12 && 16 && 18\\
& \text{Total \$} && 12 && 15 && 30 && 36 && 48 && 54
\end{align*}
$$

The domain of the situation would be **_all positive real numbers_**. You can babysit for a fractional amount of time but not a negative amount of time. The domain would also be **_all positive real numbers_**. You can earn fractional money, but not negative money.

If you read a book and can read twenty pages an hour, there is a relationship between how many hours you read and how many pages you read. You may even know that you could write the formula as either:

$$
\begin{align*}
n & = 20 \cdot h && n = \text{number of pages;} && h = \text{time measured in hours. OR...}\\
h & = \frac{n}{20}
\end{align*}
$$

To graph this relation, you could make a chart. By picking values for the number of hours, you can determine the number of pages read. By graphing these coordinates, you can visualize the relation.

| **Hours** | **Pages** |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | 20  |
| 1.5 | 30  |
| 2   | 40  |
| 3.5 | 70  |
| 5   | 100 |

![0](media/101.png "Figure 5: This relation appears to form a straight line. Therefore, the relationship between the total number of read pages and the number of hours can be called **linear**. The study of linear relationships is the focus of this chapter.")

### 4.2 Graphs of Linear Equations

<article>

In Chapter 3, you learned how to solve equations in one variable. The answer was of the form _variable_ = _some number_. In this lesson, you will learn how to solve equations with two variables. Below are several examples of two-variable equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
p& =20(h)\\
m& =8.15(h)\\
y& =4x+7
\end{align*}
$$

You have seen each of these equations in a previous lesson. Their solutions are not one value because there are _two variables_. The solutions to these equations are _pairs of numbers_. These pairs of numbers can be graphed in a Cartesian plane.

The solutions to an equation in two variables are sets of ordered pairs.

The solutions to a **linear equation** are the coordinates on the graphed line.

By making a table, you are finding the solutions to the equation with two variables.

Example: _A taxi fare costs more the further you travel. Taxis usually charge a fee on top of the per-mile charge. In this case, the taxi charges $3 as a set fee and $0.80 per mile traveled. Find all the possible solutions to this equation._

Solution: Here is the equation linking the cost in dollars $(y)$ to hire a taxi and the distance traveled in miles $(x)$: $y=0.8x+3$.

This is an equation in two variables. By creating a table, we can graph these ordered pairs to find the solutions.

| **$x$ (miles)** | **$y$ (cost $)** |
| --- | --- |
| 0   | 3   |
| 10  | 11  |
| 20  | 19  |
| 30  | 27  |
| 40  | 35  |

![0](media/103.png "Figure 1: The solutions to the taxi problem are located on the green line graphed above. To find any cab ride cost, you just need to find the $y-$ordinate of the desired $x-$_abscissa_.")

**_Multimedia Link:_** To see more simple examples of graphing linear equations by hand, view the video

[Khan Academy graphing lines](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UrcUfBizyw) (9:49)

.

The narrator of the video models graphing linear equations by using a table of values to plot points and then connecting those points with a line. This process reinforces the procedure of graphing lines by hand.

Graphs of Horizontal and Vertical Lines
---------------------------------------

Not all graphs are slanted or **oblique**. Some are horizontal or vertical. Read through the next situation to see why.

Example: _“Mad-cabs” have an unusual offer going on. They are charging $7.50 for a taxi ride of any length within the city limits. Graph the function that relates the cost of hiring the taxi $(y)$ to the length of the journey in miles $(x)$._

Solution: No matter the mileage, your cab fare will be $7.50. To see this visually, create a graph. You can also create a table to visualize the situation.

![0](media/104.png "Figure 2: | **\# of miles** $(x)$ | **Cost** $(y)$ |")
| --- | --- |
| 0   | 7.50 |
| 10  | 7.50 |
| 15  | 7.50 |
| 25  | 7.50 |
| 60  | 7.50 |

Because the mileage can be anything, the equation should relate only to the restricted value, in this case, $y$. The equation that represents this situation is:

$$
y=7.50
$$

Whenever there is an equation of the form $y= \text{constant}$, the graph is a horizontal line that intercepts the $y-$axis at the value of the constant.

Similarly, if there is an equation of the form $x=\text{constant}$, the graph is a vertical line that intercepts the $x-$axis at the value of the constant. Notice that this is a relation but not a function because each $x$ value (there’s only one in this case) corresponds to many (actually an infinite number) $y$ values.

**Example 1:** _Plot the following graphs._

(a) $y=4$

(b) $y=-4$

(c) $x=4$

(d) $x=-4$

**Solution:**

(a) $y=4$ is a horizontal line that crosses the $y-$axis at 4.

(b) $y=-4$ is a horizontal line that crosses the $y-$axis at –4.

(c) $x=4$ is a vertical line that crosses the $x-$axis at 4.

(d) $x=-4$ is a vertical line that crosses the $x-$axis at –4.

-----------------------

Analyzing linear graphs is a part of life – whether you are trying to decide to buy stock, figure out if your blog readership is increasing, or predict the temperature from a weather report. Although linear graphs can be quite complex, such as a six-month stock graph, many are very basic to analyze.

The graph below shows the solutions to the price before tax and the price after tax at a particular store. Determine the price after tax of a $6.00 item.

By finding the appropriate $x-$_abscissa_ ($6.00), you can find the solution, the $y-$_ordinate_ (approximately $6.80). Therefore, the price after tax of a $6.00 item is approximately $6.80.

### 4.3 Graphs Using Intercepts

<article>

As you may have seen in the previous lesson, graphing solutions to an equation of two variables can be time-consuming. Fortunately, there are several ways to make graphing solutions easier. This lesson will focus on graphing a line by finding its intercepts. Lesson 4.5 will show you how to graph a line using its slope and $y-$intercept.

In geometry, there is a postulate that states, “Two points determine a line.” Therefore, to draw any line, all you need is two points. One way is to find its **intercepts**.

An **intercept** is the point at which a graphed equation crosses an axis.

The $x-$**intercept** is an ordered pair at which the line crosses the $x-$axis (the horizontal axis). Its ordered pair has the form $(x,0)$.

The $y-$**intercept** is an ordered pair at which the line crosses the $y-$axis (the vertical axis). Its ordered pair has the form $(0,y)$

By finding the intercepts of an equation, you can quickly graph all the possible solutions to the equation.

Finding Intercepts Using Substitution
-------------------------------------

Remember that the Substitution Property allows the replacement of a variable with a numerical value or another expression. You can use this property to help find the intercepts of an equation.

**Example:** _Graph_ $2x+3y=-6$ _using its intercepts_.

**Solution:** The $x-$intercept has an ordered pair $(x,0)$. Therefore, the $y-$coordinate has a value of zero. By substituting zero for the variable of $y$, the equation becomes:

$$
2x+3(0)=-6
$$

Continue solving for $x$:

$$
\begin{align*}
2x+0& =-6\\
2x& =-6\\
x& =-3
\end{align*}
$$

The $x-$intercept has an ordered pair of (–3, 0).

**Repeat** the process to find the $y-$intercept. The ordered pair of the $y-$intercept is $(0,y)$. Using substitution,

$$
\begin{align*}
2(0)+3y& =-6\\
3y& =-6\\
y& =-2
\end{align*}
$$

The $y-$intercept has the ordered pair (0, –2).

To graph the line formed by the solutions of the equation $2x+3y=-6$, graph the two intercepts and connect them with a straight line.

![0](media/110.png "Figure 1: **Example:** _Graph_ $4x-2y=8$ _using its intercepts_.")

**Solution:** Determine the $x-$intercept by substituting zero for the variable $y$.

$$
\begin{align*}
4x-2(0)& =8\\
4x& =8\\
x& =2
\end{align*}
$$

The ordered pair of the $x-$intercept is (2, 0). By repeating this process, you find the $y-$intercept has the ordered pair (0, –4). Graph these two ordered pairs and connect with a line.

![0](media/111.png "Figure 2: Finding Intercepts Using the Cover-Up Method")
--------------------------------------------

By finding an intercept, you are substituting the value of zero in for one of the variables.

To find the $x-$**intercept**, substitute zero for the $y$\-**value**.

To find the $y-$**intercept**, substitute zero for the $x$\-**value**.

A second method of finding the intercepts is called the Cover-Up Method. Using the Multiplication Property of Zero $a(0)=0$, you can “cover-up” the other variable and solve for the intercept you wish to find.

**Example:** _Graph_ $-7x-3y=21$ _using its intercepts_.

**Solution:** To solve for the $y-$intercept we set $x=0$ and cover up the $x$ term:

![0](media/112.png "Figure 3: $$")
\begin{align*}
-3y& =21\\
y& =-7 && (0,-7) \ \text{is the} \ y-intercept \text.
\end{align*}
$$

To solve for the $x-$intercept, cover up the $y-$variable and solve for $x$:

![0](media/113.png "Figure 4: $$")
\begin{align*}
-7x& =21\\
x& =-3 && (-3,0) \ \text{is the} \ x-intercept \text.
\end{align*}
$$

Now graph by first plotting the intercepts then drawing a line through these points.

![0](media/114.png "Figure 5: **Example 1:** _Jose has $30 to spend on food for a class barbeque. Hot dogs cost $0.75 each (including the bun) and burgers cost $1.25 (including bun and salad). Plot a graph that shows all the combinations of hot dogs and burgers he could buy for the barbecue, spending exactly $30._")

**Solution:** Begin by translating this sentence into an algebraic equation. Let $y=$ _the number of hot dogs_ and $x=$ _the number of burgers_.

$$
1.25(x)+ 0.75(y)=30
$$

Find the intercepts of the graph. This example will use the Cover-Up Method. Feel free to use Substitution if you prefer.

![0](media/115.png "Figure 6: $$")
\begin{align*}
0.75y& =30\\
y& =40 && y-intercept(0,40)
\end{align*}
$$

![0](media/116.png "Figure 7: $$")
\begin{align*}
1.25x& =30\\
x& =24 && x-intercept(24,0)
\end{align*}
$$

By graphing Jose’s situation, you can determine the combinations of hot dogs and burgers he can purchase for exactly $30.00.

### 4.4 Slope and Rate of Change

<article>

The pitch of a roof, the slant of a ladder against a wall, the incline of a road, and even your treadmill incline are all examples of slope.

The **slope** of a line measures its steepness (either negative or positive).

For example, if you have ever driven through a mountain range, you may have seen a sign stating, “10% incline.” The percent tells you how steep the incline is. You have probably seen this on a treadmill too. The incline on a treadmill measures how steep you are walking uphill. Below is a more formal definition of slope.

The **slope** of a line is the vertical change divided by the horizontal change.

In the figure below, a car is beginning to climb up a hill. The height of the hill is 3 meters and the length of the hill is 4 meters. Using the definition above, the slope of this hill can be written as $\frac{3 \ meters}{4 \ meters}=\frac{3}{4}$. Because $\frac{3}{4}=75\%$, we can say this hill has a 75% positive slope.

![0](media/118.png "Figure 1: Similarly, if the car begins to descend _down_ a hill, you can still determine the slope.")

![0](media/119.png "Figure 2: $$")
Slope=\frac{vertical \ change}{horizontal \ change}=\frac{-3}{4}
$$

The slope in this instance is negative because the car is traveling downhill.

Another way to think of slope is: $slope=\frac{rise}{run}$.

When graphing an equation, slope is a very powerful tool. It provides the directions on how to get from one ordered pair to another. To determine slope, it is helpful to draw a **_slope-triangle_**.

Using the following graph, choose two ordered pairs that have integer values such as (–3, 0) and (0, –2). Now draw in the slope triangle by connecting these two points as shown.

![0](media/120.png "Figure 3: The vertical leg of the triangle represents the _rise_ of the line and the horizontal leg of the triangle represents the _run_ of the line. A third way to represent slope is:")

$$
slope=\frac{rise}{run}
$$

Starting at the left-most coordinate, count the number of vertical units and horizontal units it took to get to the right-most coordinate.

$$
slope=\frac{rise}{run}=\frac{-2}{+3}=-\frac{2}{3}
$$

**Example 1:** Find the slope of the line graphed below.

**Solution:** Begin by finding two pairs of ordered pairs with integer values: (1, 1) _and_ (0, –2).

![0](media/121.png "Figure 4: Draw in the slope triangle.")

Count the number of vertical units to get from the left ordered pair to the right.

Count the number of horizontal units to get from the left ordered pair to the right.

$$
Slope=\frac{rise}{run}=\frac{+3}{+1}=\frac{3}{1}
$$

A more algebraic way to determine a slope is by using a formula. The formula for slope is:

The slope between any two points $(x_1,y_1 )$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is: $slope=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$.

$(x_1,y_1)$ represents one of the two ordered pairs and $(x_2,y_2)$ represents the other. The following example helps show this formula.

**Example 2:** Using the slope formula, determine the slope of the equation graphed in Example 1.

**Solution:** Use the integer ordered pairs used to form the slope triangle: (1, 1) _and_ (0, –2). Since (1, 1) is written first, it can be called $(x_1,y_1)$. That means $(0,-2)=(x_2,y_2)$

Use the formula: $slope=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{-2-1}{0-1}=\frac{-3}{-1}=\frac{3}{1}$

As you can see, the slope is the same regardless of the method you use. If the ordered pairs are fractional or spaced very far apart, it is easier to use the formula than to draw a slope triangle.

Types of Slopes
---------------

Slopes come in four different types: negative, zero, positive, and undefined. The first graph of this lesson had a negative slope. The second graph had a positive slope. Slopes with zero slopes are lines without any steepness, and undefined slopes cannot be computed.

Any line with a slope of zero will be a **horizontal** line with equation $y = some \ number$.

Any line with an undefined slope will be a **vertical** line with equation $x = some \ number$.

We will use the next two graphs to illustrate the previous definitions.

![0](media/122.png "Figure 5: To determine the slope of _line_ $A$, you need to find two ordered pairs with integer values.")

_Sample:_ (–4, 3) _and_ (1, 3). Choose one ordered pair to represent $(x_1,y_1)$ and the other to represent $(x_2,y_2)$.

Now apply the formula: $slope=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{3-3}{1-(-4)}=\frac{0}{1+4}=0$.

To determine the slope of _line_ $B$, you need to find two ordered pairs on this line with integer values and apply the formula.

_Sample:_ (5, 1) _and_ (5, –6)

$$
slope=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{-6-1}{5-5}=\frac{-7}{0}=Undefined
$$

It is impossible to divide by zero, so the slope of _line_ $B$ cannot be determined and is called **undefined**.

Finding Rate of Change
----------------------

When finding the slope of real-world situations, it is often referred to as **rate of change**. “Rate of change” means the same as “slope.” If you are asked to find the rate of change, use the slope formula or make a slope triangle.

**Example 3:** _Andrea has a part-time job at the local grocery store. She saves for her vacation at a rate of $15 every week. Find her rate of change._

**Solution:** Begin by finding two ordered pairs. You can make a chart or use the Substitution Property to find two coordinates.

_Sample:_ (2, 30) and (10, 150). Since (2, 30) is written first, it can be called $(x_1,y_1)$. That means $(10,150)=(x_2,y_2)$.

Use the formula: $slope=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{150-30}{10-2}=\frac{120}{8}=\frac{15}{1}$.

Andrea’s rate of change is $15/1 _week_.

**Multimedia Link:** For more information regarding rates of change, visit NCTM’s website for an interactive – http://standards.nctm.org/document/eexamples/chap6/6.2/part2.htm – rate of change activity.

**Example 4:** _A candle has a starting length of 10 inches. Thirty minutes after lighting it, the length is 7 inches. Determine the rate of change in the length of the candle as it burns. Determine how long the candle takes to completely burn to nothing._

**Solution:** Begin by finding two ordered pairs. The candle begins at 10 inches in length. So at time “zero”, the length is 10 inches. The ordered pair representing this is (0, 10). 30 minutes later, the candle is 7 inches, so (30, 7). Since (0, 10) is written first, it can be called $(x_1,y_1)$. That means $(30,7)=(x_2,y_2)$.

Use the formula: $slope=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{7-10}{30-0}=\frac{-3}{30}=-\frac{1}{10}$.

The candle has a rate of change is –1 _inch_/10 _minutes_. To find the length of time it will take for the candle to burn out, you can create a graph, use guess and check, or solve an equation.

![0](media/123.png "Figure 6: You can create a graph to help visualize the situation. By plotting the ordered pairs you were given and by drawing a straight line connecting them, you can estimate it will take 100 minutes for the candle to burn out.")

Example: _Examine the following graph. It represents a journey made by a large delivery truck on a particular day. During the day, the truck made two deliveries, each one taking one hour. The driver also took a one-hour break for lunch. Identify what is happening at each stage of the journey (stages $A$ through $E$)._

![0](media/124.png "Figure 7: **Truck’s Distance from Home by Time**")

Here is the driver's journey.

A. The truck sets off and travels 80 miles in 2 hours.

B. The truck covers no distance for 1 hour.

C. The truck covers $(120 - 80) = 40$ miles in 1 hour.

D. The truck covers no distance for 2 hours.

E. The truck covers 120 miles in 2 hours.

**Solution:** To identify what is happening at each leg of the driver’s journey, you are being asked to find each rate of change.

The rate of change for _line segment_ $A$ can be found using either the formula or the slope triangle. Using the slope triangle, $vertical \ change=80$ and the $horizontal \ change=2$.

$slope=\frac{rise}{run}=\frac{80 \ miles}{2 \ hours}= 40 \ miles/1 \ hour$.

Segments $B$ and $D$ are horizontal lines and each has a slope of zero.

The rate of change for _line segment_ $C$ using the slope formula: $\text{Rate of change} = \frac{\triangle y}{\triangle x} = \frac{(120-80) \ miles}{(4-3) \ hours}= 40 \ \text{miles per hour}$.

The rate of change for _line segment_ $E$ using the slope formula: $\text{Rate of change} = \frac{\triangle y}{\triangle x} = \frac{(0-120) \ miles}{(8-6) \ hours}= \frac{-120 \ miles}{2 \ hours}=-60 \ \text{miles per hour}$. The truck is traveling at **negative** 60 mph. A better way to say this is that the truck is **returning home at a rate of 60** **_mph_**.

### 4.5 Graphs Using Slope-Intercept Form

<article>

So far in this chapter, you have learned how to graph the solutions to an equation in two variables by making a table and by using its intercepts. The last lesson introduced the formulas for slope. This lesson will combine intercepts and slope into a new formula.

You have seen different forms of this formula several times in this chapter. Below are several examples.

$$
\begin{align*}
2x+5& =y\\
y& =\frac{-1}{3} x+11\\
d & =60(h)+45
\end{align*}
$$

The proper name given to each of these equations is **slope-intercept form** because each equation tells the slope and the $y-$intercept of the line.

The **slope-intercept form of an equation** is: $y=(slope)x+(y-$intercept).

$y=(m)x+b$, where $m = slope$ and $b = y-$intercept

This equation makes it quite easy to graph the solutions to an equation of two variables because it gives you two necessary values:

1.  The starting position of your graph (the $y-$intercept)
2.  The directions to find your second coordinate (the slope)

**Example 1:** _Determine the slope and the $y-$intercept of the first two equations in the opener of this lesson._

**Solution:** Using the definition of slope-intercept form; $2x+5=y$ has a slope of 2 and a $y-$intercept of

(0, 5)

$y=\frac{-1}{3}x+11$ has a slope of $\frac{-1}{3}$ and a $y-$intercept of (0, 11)

Slope-intercept form applies to many equations, even those that do not look like the “standard” equation.

**Example:** _Determine the slope and $y-$intercept of $7x=y$._

**Solution:** At first glance, this does not look like the “standard” equation. However, we can substitute values for the slope and $y-$intercept.

$$
7x+0=y
$$

This means the slope is 7 and the $y-$intercept is 0.

**Example:** _Determine the slope and $y-$intercept of $y=5$_.

**Solution:** Using what you learned in the last lesson, the slope of every line of the form $y=some \ number$ is zero because it is a horizontal line. Rewriting our original equation to fit slope-intercept form yields:

$$
y=(0)x+5
$$

Therefore, the slope is zero and the $y-$intercept is (0, 5).

You can also use a graph to determine the slope and $y-$intercept of a line.

**Example:** _Determine the slope and $y-$intercept of the lines graphed below._

**Solution:** Beginning with line $a$, you can easily see the graph crosses the $y-$axis (the $y-$intercept) at (0, 5). From this point, find a second coordinate on the line crossing at a **lattice point**.

![0](media/130.png "Figure 1: _Line $a$:_ The $y-$intercept is (0, 5). The line also passes through (2, 3).")

$$
\text{slope} \ m=\frac{\triangle y}{\triangle x} = \frac{-2}{2}=-1
$$

_Line_ $b$: The $y-$intercept is (0, 2). The line also passes through (1, 5).

$$
\text{slope} \ m = \frac{\triangle y}{\triangle x} = \frac{3}{1}=3
$$

The remaining lines will be left for you in the Practice Set.

Graphing an Equation Using Slope-Intercept Form
-----------------------------------------------

Once we know the slope and the $y-$intercept of an equation, it is quite easy to graph the solutions.

Example: _Graph the solutions to the equation_ $y=2x+5$.

Solution: The equation is in slope-intercept form. To graph the solutions to this equation, you should start at the $y-$intercept. Then, using the slope, find a second coordinate. Finally, draw a line through the ordered pairs.

![0](media/131.png "Figure 2: **Example 2:** _Graph the equation_ $y=-3x+5$")

**Solution:** Using the definition of slope-intercept form, this equation has a $y-$intercept of (0, 5) and a slope of $\frac{-3}{1}$.

![0](media/132.png "Figure 3: Slopes of Parallel Lines")
------------------------

**Parallel lines** will never **intersect**, or cross. The only way for two lines never to cross is if the method of finding additional coordinates is the same.

Therefore, it's true that **parallel lines** have the same slope.

You will use this concept in Chapter 5 as well as in geometry.

**Example 3:** _Determine the slope of any line parallel to_ $y=-3x+5$

**Solution:** Because parallel lines have the same slope, the slope of any line parallel to $y=-3x+5$ must also be –3.

### 4.6 Direct Variation

<article>

At the local farmer’s market, you saw someone purchase 5 pounds of strawberries and pay $12.50. You want to buy strawberries too, but you want only 2 pounds. How much would you expect to pay?

![0](media/135.png "Figure 1: This situation is an example of a **direct variation**. You would expect that the strawberries are priced on a “per pound” basis, and that if you buy two-fifths of the amount of strawberries, you would pay two-fifths of $12.50 for your strawberries, or $5.00. Similarly, if you bought 10 pounds of strawberries (twice the amount), you would pay $25.00 (twice $12.50), and if you did not buy any strawberries you would pay nothing.")

**Direct Variation** can be expressed as the equation $y=(k)x$, where $k$ is called the constant of variation.

Direct variation occurs when:

* The fraction $\frac{rise}{run}$ or $\frac{change \ in \ y}{change \ in \ x}$ is always the same, and
* The ordered pair (0, 0) is a solution to the situation.

**Example:** _If $y$ varies directly with $x$ according to the relationship $y=k \cdot x$, and $y=7.5$ when $x=2.5$, determine the constant of proportionality, $k$._

**Solution:** We can solve for the constant of proportionality using substitution.

Substitute $x=2.5$ and $y=7.5$ into the equation $y=k \cdot x$.

$$
\begin{align*}
7.5 & = k(2.5) && \text{Divide both sides by} \ 2.5.\\
\frac{7.5}{2.5}& =k=3
\end{align*}
$$

The constant of variation (or the constant of proportionality) is 3.

You can use this information to graph this direct variation situation. Remember that all direct variation situations cross the origin. You can plot the ordered pair (0, 0) and use the constant of variation as your slope.

![0](media/136.png "Figure 2: **Example:** _Explain why each of the following equations are not examples of direct variation._")

$$
\begin{align*}
y& =\frac{2}{x}\\
y& =5x-1\\
2x+y& =6
\end{align*}
$$

**Solution:** In equation 1, the variable is in the denominator of the fraction, violating the definition.

In equation 2, there is a $y-$intercept of –1, violating the definition.

In equation 3, there is also a $y-$intercept, violating the definition.

Translating a Sentence into a Direct Variation Equation
-------------------------------------------------------

Direct variation equations use the same phrase to give the reader a clue. The phrase is either “directly proportional” or “varies directly.”

**Example:** _The area of a square varies directly as the square of its side._

**Solution:** The first variable you encounter is “area.” Think of this as your $y$. Think the phrase “varies directly” means $= (k)\times$. The second variable is “square of its side.” Call this letter $s$.

Now translate into an equation: $y=(k)\times s^2$.

You’ve written your first direct variation equation.

**Example 2:** The distance you travel is directly proportional to the time you have been traveling. Write this situation as a direct variation equation.

**Solution:** The first variable is _distance_; call it $d$. The second variable is _time you have been traveling_, call it $t$. Apply the direct variation definition:

$$
d=(k) \times t
$$

Solving Real-World Situations Using Direct Variation
----------------------------------------------------

Direct variation has numerous real-world examples. You have already seen three examples: the area of a square is directly proportional to its side length; the distance you travel varies directly as the time you have been driving; and the total cost is directly proportional to the number of pounds of strawberries you purchase.

**Newton's Second Law**

In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published the famous _Principea Mathematica_. It contained his Second Law of Motion. This law is often written as: $F=m \cdot a$, _where_ $F=$ _the amount of force applied to an object with mass_ $(m)$ and $a=$ _acceleration._

Acceleration is given in the units _meters_/_second_$^2$ and force is given in units of _Newtons_.

**Example:** _If a 175 Newton force causes a heavily loaded shopping cart to accelerate down the aisle with an acceleration of $2.5\ m/s^2$, calculate:_

(i) _The mass of the shopping cart._

(ii) _The force needed to accelerate the same cart at $6 \ m/s^2$._

**Solution:** (i) This question is basically asking us to solve for the constant of proportionality. Let us compare the two formulas.

$$
\begin{align*}
& y=k \cdot x && \text{The direct variation equation}\\
& F = m \cdot a && \text{Newton's Second law}
\end{align*}
$$

We see that the two equations have the same form. The variable $y$ is equal to force and $x$ is equal to acceleration.

$$
175=m \cdot 2.5
$$

Now solve for $m$, the constant of variation.

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{175}{2.5} & =\frac{m \cdot 2.5}{2.5}\\
m & = 70
\end{align*}
$$

(ii) Now you know the constant of variation is 70. In this formula, 70 represents the mass. To find the force needed to move the cart at an accelerated rate of 6 _meters_/_second_, substitute 6 for $a$ and evaluate the equation.

When $a=6$, $F=70 \cdot 6=420$.

The force needed to accelerate the cart is 420 Newtons.

Solving Direct Variation Using Proportions
------------------------------------------

You can use the Cross Products Theorem of proportions to solve direct variation situations. Because the fraction $\frac{rise}{run}$ is constant in a direct variation situation, you can create a proportion.

Ohm’s Law states that the voltage $(V)$ is equal to the electrical current $(I)$ in amps times the resistance $(R)$ in ohms. Translating this to an equation, $V=I \cdot R$.

Suppose an electronics device passed a current of 1.3 amps at a voltage of 2.6 volts. What was the current when the voltage was increased to 12 volts?

Ohm’s Law matches with the definition of direct variation, so you can write a proportion. $\frac{2.6 \ volts}{1.3 \ amps}=\frac{12 \ volts}{I \ amps}$. Using the Cross Products Theorem, solve for $I$. $I=6$. Therefore, when the voltage was increased to 12 volts, the electronics device passed a current of 6 amps.

### 4.7 Linear Function Graphs

<article>

So far, the term **function** has been used to describe many of the equations we have been graphing. The concept of a function is extremely important in mathematics. Not all equations are functions. To be a function, for each value of $x$ there is one and only one value for $y$.

**Definition:** A **function** is a relationship between two variables such that the input value has ONLY one unique output value.

Recall from Lesson 1.5 that a function rule replaces the variable $y$ with its function name, usually $f(x)$. Remember that these parentheses do not mean multiplication. They separate the function name from the independent variable, $x$.

&nbsp;

$$
\begin{align*}
& \quad \ input\\
& \quad \ \ \ \downarrow\\
& \quad \underbrace{f(x)}= y \leftarrow output\\
& \ function\\
& \quad \ \ box
\end{align*}
$$

$f(x)$ is read “the function $f$ of $x$” or simply “$f$ of $x$.”

If the function looks like this: $h(x)=3x-1$, it would be read $h$ of $x$ equals 3 times $x$ minus 1.

Using Function Notation
-----------------------

Function notation allows you to easily see the input value for the independent variable inside the parentheses.

**Example:** Consider the function $f(x)=-\frac{1}{2} x^2$.

Evaluate $f(4)$.

**Solution:** The value inside the parentheses is the value of the variable $x$. Use the Substitution Property to evaluate the function for $x=4$.

$$
\begin{align*}
f(4)& =-\frac{1}{2}(4^2)\\
f(4)& = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot 16\\
f(4)& =-8
\end{align*}
$$

To use function notation, the equation must be written in terms of $x$. This means that the $y-$variable must be isolated on one side of the equal sign.

**Example:** Rewrite $9x+3y=6$ using function notation.

**Solution:** The goal is to rearrange this equation so the equation looks like $y=$. Then replace $y=$ with $f(x)=$.

$$
\begin{align*}
9x+3y& =6 && \text{Subtract} \ 9x \ \text{from both sides}.\\
3y& =6-9x && \text{Divide by} \ 3.\\
y& =\frac{6-9x}{3}=2-3x\\
f(x)& =2-3x
\end{align*}
$$

Functions as Machines
---------------------

You can think of a function as a machine. You start with an input (some value), the machine performs the operations (it does the work), and your output is the answer. For example, $f(x)=3x+2$ takes **_some number_**, $x$, multiplies it by 3 and adds 2. As a machine, it would look like this:

![0](media/138.png "Figure 1: When you use the function machine to evaluate $f(2)$, the solution is $f(2)=8$.")

**Example 1:** A function is defined as $f(x)=6x-36$. Determine the following:

a) $f(2)$

b) $f(p)$

**Solution:**

a) Substitute $x = 2$ into the function $f(x): \ f(2)=6 \cdot 2 - 36 = 12-36=-24$.

b) Substitute $x = p$ into the function $f(x): \ f(p)=6p-36$.

Graphing Linear Functions
-------------------------

You can see that the notation $f(x)=$ and $y=$ are interchangeable. This means you can substitute the notation $y=$ for $f(x)=$ and use all the concepts you have learned in this chapter.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Graph} \ f(x)& =\frac{1}{3}x+1\\
\text{Replace} \ f(x)& = \text{with} \ y=\\
y& =\frac{1}{3} x+1
\end{align*}
$$

This equation is in slope-intercept form. You can now graph the function by graphing the $y-$intercept and then using the slope as a set of directions to find your second coordinate.

**Example:** Graph $f(x)=\frac{3x+5}{4}$.

**Solution:** The first step is to rewrite the single fraction as two separate fractions.

$$
f(x)=\frac{3x+5}{4}=\frac{3}{4} x+\frac{5}{4}
$$

This equation is in slope-intercept form. The $y-$intercept is at the ordered pair (0, $\frac{5}{4}$) and the slope is $\frac{rise}{run}=\frac{3}{4}$. Beginning at the $y-$intercept and using the slope to find a second coordinate, you get the graph:

![0](media/140.png "Figure 3: The previous graph, written by T. Barron and S. Katsberg from the University of Georgia http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/emt668/EMAT6680.Folders/Barron/unit/Lesson%204/4.html, shows the relationship between the salary (in thousands of dollars) and the taxes paid (in thousands of dollars) in red. The blue function represents a direct variation situation in which the constant of variation (or the **slope**) is 0.30, or a 30% tax rate. This direct variation represents a flat tax of 30%.")

The red line has three slopes. The first line from $0 to $15,000 has a slope of 0.20, or 20%. The second portion of the line from $15,000 to $45,000 has a slope of 0.25, or 25% tax rate. The slope of the line greater than $45,000 of salary is 0.35, or 35%.

Suppose you wanted to compare the amount of taxes you would pay if your salary was $60,000. If the blue line was $blue(s)$ and the red line was $red(s)$, then you would evaluate each function for $s=60,000$.

Using the graph, $blue(60)=18$ and $red(60)=15$. Therefore, you would pay more taxes with the blue line tax rate than the red line tax rate. We will look at how to use graphs as a problem-solving strategy in the next lesson.

### 4.8 Problem-Solving Strategies: Read a Graph; Make a Graph

<article>

Graphing is a very useful tool when analyzing a situation. This lesson will focus on using graphs to help solve linear situations that occur in real life.

Remember the 4-Step Problem-Solving Plan:

1.  Understand the problem and underline or highlight key information.
2.  Translate the problem and devise a method to solve the problem.
3.  Carry out the plan and solve the problem.
4.  Check and interpret your answer. Does it make sense?

**Example:** _A cell phone company is offering its costumers the following deal. You can buy a new cell phone for $60 and pay a monthly flat rate of $40 per month for unlimited calls. How much money will this deal cost you after 9 months?_

**Solution:** Begin by translating the sentence into an algebraic equation.

$$
\text{cell phone} = \$60, \text{calling plan} = \$40 \ \text{per month}
$$

Let $m=$_the number of months_ and $t=$_total cost_. The equation becomes

$$
t(m)=60+40m
$$

You could use guess and check or solve this equation. However, this lesson focuses on using a graph to problem-solve. This equation is in slope-intercept form. By graphing the line of this equation, you will find all the ordered pairs that are solutions to the cell phone problem.

![0](media/145.png "Figure 1: Finding the cost at month 9, you can see the cost is approximately $425.00. To check if this is approximately correct, substitute 9 in for the variable $m$.")

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Phone} & = \$60\\
\text{Calling plan} & = \$40 \times 9 = \$360\\
\text{Total cost} & = \$420.
\end{align*}
$$

Our answer, $425.00 is approximately equal to the exact solution $420.00.

**Example:** _Christine took one hour to read 22 pages of_ “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.” _She has 100 pages left to read in order to finish the book. Assuming that she reads at a constant rate of pages per hour, how much time should she expect to spend reading in order to finish the book?_

![0](media/146.png "Figure 2: **Solution:** We do not have enough information to write an equation. We do not know the slope or the $y-$intercept. However, we have two points we can graph. We know that if Christine had never picked up the book, she would have read zero pages. So it takes Christine 0 hours to read 0 pages. We also know it took Christine one hour to read 22 pages. The two coordinates we can graph are (0, 0) _and_ (1, 22).")

![0](media/147.png "Figure 3: Using the graph and finding 100 pages, you can determine it will take Christine about 4.5 hours to read 100 pages.")

You can also think of this as a direct variation situation and solve it by writing a proportion.

$$
\frac{22 \ pages}{1 \ hour}=\frac{100 \ pages}{h \ hours}
$$

By using the Cross Products Theorem, you can find out $h \approx 4.55$. It will take Christine about 4.55 hours to read 100 pages, which is very close to your original estimate of 4.5 hours.

## 5.0 Writing Linear Equations

<article>

You saw in the last chapter that linear graphs and equations are used to describe a variety of real-life situations. In mathematics, the goal is to find an equation that explains a situation as presented in a problem. In this way, we can determine the rule that describes the relationship. Knowing the equation or rule is very important since it allows us to find the values for the variables. There are different ways to find the best equation to represent a problem. The methods are based on the information you can gather from the problem.

This chapter focuses on several formulas used to help write equations of linear situations, such as slope-intercept form, standard form, and point-slope form. This chapter also teaches you how to fit a line to data and how to use a fitted line to predict data.

### 5.1 Linear Equations in Slope-Intercept Form

<article>

Previously, you learned how to graph solutions to two-variable equations in slope-intercept form. This lesson focuses on how to write an equation for a graphed line. There are two things you will need from the graph to write the equation in slope-intercept form:

1.  The $y-$intercept of the graph
2.  The slope of the line

Having these two pieces of information will allow you to make the appropriate substitutions in the slope-intercept formula. Recall from the last chapter,

Slope-intercept form: $y=(slope)x+ (y-intercept)$ or $y=mx+b$

**Example 1:** Write the equation for a line with a slope of 4 and a $y-$intercept (0, –3).

**Solution:** Slope-intercept form requires two things: the slope and $y-$intercept. To write the equation, you substitute the values into the formula.

$$
\begin{align*}
y& =(slope)x+ (y-intercept)\\
y& =4x+(-3)\\
y& =4x-3
\end{align*}
$$

You can also use a graphed line to determine the slope and $y-$intercept.

**Example 2:** _Use the graph below to write its equation in slope-intercept form._

![0](media/152.png "Figure 1: **Solution:** The $y-$intercept is (0, 2). Using the slope triangle, you can determine the slope is $\frac{rise}{run}=\frac{-3}{-1}=\frac{3}{1}$. Substituting the value 2 for $b$ and the value 3 for $m$, the equation for this line is $y=3x+2$.")

Writing an Equation Given the Slope and a Point
-----------------------------------------------

Sometimes it may be difficult to determine the $y-$intercept. Perhaps the $y-$intercept is rational instead of an integer. Maybe you don’t know the $y-$intercept. All you have is the slope and an ordered pair. You can use this information to write the equation in slope-intercept form. To do so, you will need to follow several steps.

**Step 1:** Begin by writing the formula for slope-intercept form $y=mx+b$.

**Step 2:** Substitute the given slope for $m$.

**Step 3:** Use the ordered pair you are given $(x, y)$ and substitute these values for the variables $x$ and $y$ in the equation.

**Step 4:** Solve for $b$ (the $y-$intercept of the graph).

**Step 5:** Rewrite the original equation in Step 1, substituting the slope for $m$ and the $y-$intercept for $b$.

**Example 3:** _Write an equation for a line with slope of 4 that contains the ordered pair (–1, 5)._

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** Begin by writing the formula for slope-intercept form.

$$
y=mx+b
$$

**Step 2:** Substitute the given slope for $m$.

$$
y=4x+b
$$

**Step 3:** Use the ordered pair you are given (–1, 5) and substitute these values for the variables $x$ and $y$ in the equation.

$$
5=(4)(-1)+b
$$

**Step 4:** Solve for $b$ (the $y-$intercept of the graph).

$$
\begin{align*}
5& =-4+b\\
5+4& =-4+4+b\\
9& =b
\end{align*}
$$

**Step 5:** Rewrite $y=mx+b$, substituting the slope for $m$ and the $y-$intercept for $b$.

$$
y=4x+9
$$

**Example 4:** Write the equation for a line with a slope of –3 containing the point (3, –5).

**Solution:** Using the five-steps from above:

$$
\begin{align*}
y& =(slope)x+(y-intercept)\\
y& =-3x+b\\
-5& =-3(3)+b\\
-5& =-9+b\\
4& =b\\
y& =-3x+4
\end{align*}
$$

Writing an Equation Given Two Points
------------------------------------

In many cases, especially real-world situations, you are given neither the slope nor the $y-$intercept. You might have only two points to use to determine the equation of the line.

To find an equation for a line between two points, you need two things:

1.  The $y-$intercept of the graph
2.  The slope of the line

Previously, you learned how to determine the slope between two points. Let’s repeat the formula here.

The slope between any two points $(x_1, y_1 )$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is: $slope=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$.

The procedure for determining a line given two points is the same five-step process as writing an equation given the slope and a point.

**Example 5:** _Write the equation for the line containing the points (3, 2) and (–2, 4)._

**Solution:** You need the slope of the line. Find the line's slope by using the formula. Choose one ordered pair to represent $(x_1,y_1)$ and the other ordered pair to represent $(x_2,y_2)$.

$$
slope=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{4-2}{-2-3}=-\frac{2}{5}
$$

Now use the five-step process to find the equation for this line.

**Step 1:** Begin by writing the formula for slope-intercept form.

$$
y=mx+b
$$

**Step 2:** Substitute the given slope for $m$.

$$
y=\frac{-2}{5} x+b
$$

**Step 3:** Use one of the ordered pairs you are given (–2, 4) and substitute these values for the variables $x$ and $y$ in the equation.

$$
4=\left (\frac{-2}{5}\right )(-2)+b
$$

**Step 4:** Solve for $b$ (the $y-$intercept of the graph).

$$
\begin{align*}
4& =\frac{4}{5}+b\\
4-\frac{4}{5}& =\frac{4}{5}-\frac{4}{5}+b\\
\frac{16}{5}& =b
\end{align*}
$$

**Step 5:** Rewrite $y=mx+b$, substituting the slope for $m$ and the $y-$intercept for $b$.

$$
y=\frac{-2}{5} x+\frac{16}{5}
$$

**Example 6:** Write the equation for a line containing the points (–4, 1) and (–2, 3).

**Solution:**

1.  Start with the slope–intercept form of the line $y=mx+b$.
2.  Find the slope of the line: $m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{3-1}{-2-(-4)}=\frac{2}{2}=1$.
3.  Substitute the value of slope for $m: y=(1)x+b$.
4.  Substitute the coordinate (–2, 3) into the equation for the variables $x$ and $y : 3=-2+b \Rightarrow b=5$.
5.  Rewrite the equation, substituting the slope for $m$ and the $y-$intercept for $b$: $y=x+5$.

Writing a Function in Slope-Intercept Form
------------------------------------------

Remember that a linear function has the form $f(x)=mx+b$. Here $f(x)$ represents the $y$ values of the equation or the graph. So $y=f(x)$ and they are often used interchangeably. Using the functional notation in an equation often provides you with more information.

For instance, the expression $f(x)=mx+b$ shows clearly that $x$ is the independent variable because you **substitute** values of $x$ into the function and perform a series of operations on the value of $x$ in order to calculate the values of the dependent variable, $y$.

![0](media/153.png "Figure 2: In this case when you substitute $x$ into the function, the function tells you to multiply it by $m$ and then add $b$ to the result. This process generates all the values of $y$ you need.")

**Example 7:** Consider the function $f(x)=3x-4.$ _Find_ $f(2), f(0),$ _and_ $f(-1)$.

**Solution:** Each number in parentheses is a value of $x$ that you need to substitute into the equation of the function.

![0](media/154.png "Figure 3: $$")
f(2)=2; f(0)=-4; \ and \ f(-1)=-7
$$

Function notation tells you much more than the value of the independent variable. It also indicates a point on the graph. For example, in the above example, $f(-1)=-7$. This means the ordered pair (–1, –7) is a solution to $f(x)=3x-4$ and appears on the graphed line. You can use this information to write an equation for a function.

**Example 8:** _Write an equation for a line with $m=3.5$ and $f(-2)=1$_.

**Solution:** You know the slope and you know a point on the graph (–2, 1). Using the methods presented in this lesson, write the equation for the line.

Begin with slope-intercept form.

$$
\begin{align*}
&& y& =mx+b\\
\text{Substitute the value for the slope.} && y& =3.5x+b\\
\text{Use the ordered pair to solve for} \ b. && 1& =3.5(-2)+b\\
&& b& =8\\
\text{Rewrite the equation.} && y& =3.5x+8 \\
\text{or}    && f(x)& =3.5x+8
\end{align*}
$$

Solve Real-World Problems Using Linear Models
---------------------------------------------

Let’s apply the methods we just learned to a few application problems that can be modeled using a linear relationship.

**Example 9:** _Nadia has $200 in her savings account. She gets a job that pays $7.50 per hour and she deposits all her earnings in her savings account. Write the equation describing this problem in slope–intercept form. How many hours would Nadia need to work to have $500 in her account?_

![0](media/155.png "Figure 4: **Solution:** Begin by defining the variables:")

$y=$ amount of money in Nadia’s savings account

$x=$ number of hours

The problem gives the $y-$intercept and the slope of the equation.

We are told that Nadia has $200 in her savings account, so $b=200$.

We are told that Nadia has a job that pays $7.50 per hour, so $m=7.50$.

By substituting these values in slope–intercept form $y=mx+b$, we obtain $y=7.5x+200$.

To answer the question, substitute $500 for the value of $y$ and solve.

$$
500 = 7.5x+200 \Rightarrow 7.5x=300 \Rightarrow x=40
$$

Nadia must work 40 hours if she is to have $500 in her account.

**Example 10:** _A stalk of bamboo of the family Phyllostachys nigra grows at steady rate of 12 inches per day and achieves its full height of 720 inches in 60 days. Write the equation describing this problem in slope–intercept form. How tall is the bamboo 12 days after it started growing?_

**Solution:** Define the variables.

$y=$ the height of the bamboo plant in inches

$x=$ number of days

The problem gives the slope of the equation and a point on the line.

The bamboo grows at a rate of 12 inches per day, so $m=12$.

We are told that the plant grows to 720 inches in 60 days, so we have the point (60, 720).

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Start with the slope-intercept form of the line.} && y& =mx+b\\
\text{Substitute 12 for the slope.} && y& =12x+b\\
\text{Substitute the point} \ (60,720). && 720& =12(60)+b \Rightarrow b=0\\
\text{Substitute the value of} \ b \ \text{back into the equation.} && y& =12x
\end{align*}
$$

To answer the question, substitute the value $x=12$ to obtain $y=12(12)=144$ inches.

### 5.2 Linear Equations in Point-Slope Form

<article>

Equations can be written in many forms. The last lesson taught you how to write equations of lines in slope-intercept form. This lesson will provide a second way to write an equation of a line: **point-slope form**.

The line between any two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ can be written in the following equation: $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$.

To write an equation in point-slope form, you need two things:

1.  The slope of the line
2.  A point on the line

**Example 1:** _Write an equation for a line containing_ (9, 3) and (4, 5).

**Solution:** Begin by finding the slope.

$$
slope=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{5-3}{4-9}=-\frac{2}{5}
$$

Instead of trying to find $b$ (the $y-$intercept), you will use the point-slope formula.

$$
\begin{align*}
y-y_1& =m(x-x_1)\\
y-3& = \frac{-2}{5}(x-9)
\end{align*}
$$

It doesn't matter which point you use.

You could also use the other ordered pair to write the equation:

$$
y-5= \frac{-2}{5}(x-4)
$$

These equations may look completely different, but by solving each one for $y$, you can compare the slope-intercept form to check your answer.

$$
\begin{align*}
y-3& = \frac{-2}{5} (x-9) \Rightarrow y=\frac{-2}{5} x+\frac{18}{5}+3\\
y& =\frac{-2}{5} x+\frac{33}{5}\\
y-5& =\frac{-2}{5} (x-4) \\
y& =\frac{-2}{5} x+\frac{8}{5}+5\\
y& =\frac{-2}{5} x+\frac{33}{5}
\end{align*}
$$

This process is called **rewriting in slope-intercept form.**

**Example 2:** Rewrite $y-5=3(x-2)$ in slope-intercept form.

**Solution:** Use the Distributive Property to simplify the right side of the equation.

$$
y-5=3x-6
$$

Solve for $y$:

$$
\begin{align*}
y-5+5& =3x-6+5\\
y& =3x-1
\end{align*}
$$

Graphing Equations Using Point-Slope Form
-----------------------------------------

If you are given an equation in point-slope form, it is not necessary to re-write it in slope-intercept form in order to graph it. The point-slope form of the equation gives you enough information so you can graph the line.

**Example 3:** _Make a graph of the line given by the equation $y-2=\frac{2}{3}(x+2)$_

**Solution:** Begin by rewriting the equation to make point-slope form: $y-2= \frac{2}{3}(x-(-2))$ Now we see that point (–2, 2) is on the line and that the $\text{slope}=\frac{2}{3}$. First plot point (–2, 2) on the graph.

![0](media/160.png "Figure 1: A slope of $\frac{2}{3}$ tells you that from your point you should move 2 units up and 3 units to the right and draw another point.")

![0](media/161.png "Figure 2: Now draw a line through the two points and extend the line in both directions.")

![0](media/162.png "Figure 3: Writing a Linear Function in Point-Slope Form")
---------------------------------------------

Remember from the previous lesson that $f(x)$ and $y$ are used interchangeably. Therefore, to write a function in point-slope form, you replace $y-y_1$ with $f(x)-y_1$.

**Example 4:** _Write the equation of the linear function in point-slope form._

$m=9.8$ and $f(5.5)=12.5$

**Solution:** This function has a slope of 9.8 and contains the ordered pair (5.5, 12.5). Substituting the appropriate values into point-slope form,

$$
y-12.5=9.8(x-5.5)
$$

Replacing $y-y_1$ with $f(x)-y_1$, the equation becomes

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x)-12.5& =9.8(x-5.5)\\
f(x)-12.5 =9.8x-53.9\\
f(x) =9.8x - 41.4
\end{align*}
$$

Solving Situations Involving Point-Slope Form
---------------------------------------------

Let’s solve some word problems where point-slope form is needed.

**Example 5:** _Marciel rented a moving truck for the day. Marciel remembers only that the rental truck company charges $40 per day and some amount of cents per mile. Marciel drives 46 miles and the final amount of the bill (before tax) is $63. What is the amount per mile the truck rental company charges? Write an equation in point-slope form that describes this situation. How much would it cost to rent this truck if Marciel drove 220 miles?_

![0](media/163.png "Figure 4: **Solution:** Define the variables: $x=$ distance in miles; $y=$ cost of the rental truck in dollars. There are two ordered pairs: (0, 40) and (46, 63).")

**Step 1:** Begin by finding the slope: $\frac{63-40}{46-0}=\frac{23}{46}=\frac{1}{2}$.

**Step 2:** Substitute the slope for $m$ and one of the coordinates for $(x_1,y_1)$.

$$
y-40= \frac{1}{2} (x-0)
$$

To find out how much will it cost to rent the truck for 220 miles, substitute 220 for the variable $x$.

$$
\begin{align*}
y-40 & = \frac{1}{2} (220-0)\\
y-40 & =0.5(220) \Rightarrow y=\$150
\end{align*}
$$

### 5.3 Linear Equations in Standard Form

<article>

As the past few lessons of this chapter have shown, there are several ways to write a linear equation. This lesson introduces another method: **standard form**. You have already seen examples of standard form equations in a previous lesson. For example, here are some equations written in standard form.

$$
\begin{align*}
0.75(h)+1.25(b)& =30\\
7x-3y& =21\\
2x+3y& =-6
\end{align*}
$$

The **standard form** of a linear equation has the form $Ax+By=C$, _where_ $A,B$, _and_ $C$ _are integers and_ $A$ _and_ $B$ _are_ **_not_** _both zero_.

Equations written in standard form do not have fractional **coefficients** and the variables are written on the same side of the equation.

You should be able to rewrite any of the formulas into an alternate form.

$$
\begin{align*}
Slope-intercept \ form & \leftrightarrow Standard \ form\\
Slope-intercept \ form & \leftrightarrow Point - slope \ form\\
Point-slope \ form & \leftrightarrow Standard \ form
\end{align*}
$$

**Example 1:** _Rewrite_ $\frac{3}{4}(h)+\frac{5}{4}(b)=30$ _in standard form_.

**Solution:** According to the definition of standard form, the coefficients must be integers. So we need to **clear the fractions** of the denominator using multiplication.

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{3}{4} h+\frac{5}{4} b& =30 \rightarrow 4\left (\frac{3}{4} h+\frac{5}{4} b\right )=4(30)\\
3h+5b& =120
\end{align*}
$$

This equation is now in standard form, $A=3, B=5$, _and_ $C=120$.

**Example 2:** Rewrite $y-5=3(x-2)$ in standard form.

**Solution:** Use the Distributive Property to simplify the right side of the equation

$$
y-5=3x-6
$$

Rewrite this equation so the variables $x$ and $y$ are on the same side of the equation.

$$
\begin{align*}
y-5+6& =3x-6+6\\
y-y+1& =3x-y\\
1 &=3x-y, && \ \text{where A=3, B=-1, and C=1}.
\end{align*}
$$

**Example 3:** Rewrite $5x-7=y$ in standard form.

**Solution:** Rewrite this equation so the variables $x$ and $y$ are on the same side of the equation.

$$
\begin{align*}
5x-7+7& =y+7\\
5x-y& =y-y+7\\
5x-y& =7, && \ \text{where A=5, B=-1, and C=7}.
\end{align*}
$$

Finding Slope and $y-$Intercept of a Standard Form Equation
-----------------------------------------------------------

Slope-intercept form and point-slope form of a linear equation both contain the slope of the equation explicitly, but the standard form does not. Since the slope is such an important feature of a line, it is useful to figure out how you would find the slope if you were given the equation of the line in standard form.

Begin with standard form: $Ax+By=C$.

If you rewrite this equation in slope-intercept form, it becomes:

$$
\begin{align*}
Ax-Ax+By& =C-Ax\\
\frac{By}{B}& =\frac{-Ax+C}{B}\\
y& =\frac{-A}{B}x+\frac{C}{B}
\end{align*}
$$

When you compare this form to slope-intercept form, $y=mx+b$, you can see that the slope of a standard form equation is $\frac{-A}{B}$ and the $y-$intercept is $\frac{C}{B}$.

The **standard form** of a linear equation $Ax+By=C$ has the following:

$slope=\frac{-A}{B}$ and $y-intercept=\frac{C}{B}$.

**Example 4:** Find the slope and $y-$intercept of $2x-3y=-8$.

**Solution:** Using the definition of standard form, $A=2, B=-3,$ _and_ $C=-8$.

$$
\begin{align*}
slope & =\frac{-A}{B}=\frac{-2}{-3} \rightarrow \frac{2}{3}\\
y-intercept & =\frac{C}{B} =\frac{-8}{-3}\rightarrow \frac{8}{3}
\end{align*}
$$

The slope is $\frac{2}{3}$ and the $y-$intercept is $\frac{8}{3}$.

Applying Standard Form to Real-World Situations
-----------------------------------------------

**Example 5:** _Nimitha buys fruit at her local farmer’s market. This Saturday, oranges cost $2 per pound and cherries cost $3 per pound. She has $12 to spend on fruit. Write an equation in standard form that describes this situation. If she buys 4 pounds of oranges, how many pounds of cherries can she buy?_

![0](media/164.png "Figure 1: **Solution:** Define the variables: $x=$ pounds of oranges and $y=$ pounds of cherries.")

The equation that describes this situation is: $2x+3y=12$

If she buys 4 pounds of oranges, we substitute $x=4$ in the equation and solve for $y$.

$2(4)+3y=12 \Rightarrow 3y=12-8 \Rightarrow 3y=4 \Rightarrow y=\frac{4}{3}$. Nimitha can buy $1\frac{1}{3}$ pounds of cherries.

**Example 6:** _Jethro skateboards part of the way to school and walks for the rest of the way. He can skateboard at 7 miles per hour and he can walk at 3 miles per hour. The distance to school is 6 miles. Write an equation in standard form that describes this situation. If Jethro skateboards for $\frac{1}{2}$ an hour, how long does he need to walk to get to school?_

![0](media/165.png "Figure 2: **Solution:** Define the variables: $x=$ hours Jethro skateboards and $y=$ hours Jethro walks.")

The equation that describes this situation is $7x+3y=6$.

If Jethro skateboards $\frac{1}{2}$ hour, we substitute $x=0.5$ in the equation and solve for $y$.

$7(0.5)+3y=6 \Rightarrow 3y=6 - 3.5 \Rightarrow 3y=2.5 \Rightarrow y=\frac{5}{6}$. Jethro must walk $\frac{5}{6}$ of an hour.

### 5.4 Equations of Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

<article>

In a previous lesson, you learned how to identify parallel lines.

**Parallel lines** have the same slope.

In the following graph all the lines have the same slope. According to the definition, all these lines are parallel.

![0](media/166.png "Figure 1: **Example 1:** Are $y=\frac{1}{3} x-4$ and $-3x+9y=18$ parallel?")

**Solution:** The slope of the first line is $\frac{1}{3}$. Any line parallel to this must also have a slope of $\frac{1}{3}$.

Find the slope of the second equation: $A=-3, B=9$

$$
slope=\frac{-A}{B}=\frac{3}{9} \rightarrow \frac{1}{3}
$$

These two lines have the same slope so they are parallel.

Slopes of Perpendicular Lines
-----------------------------

Lines can be parallel, **coincident** (overlap each other), or intersecting (crossing). Lines that intersect at $90^\circ$ angles have a special name: **perpendicular lines**. The slopes of perpendicular lines have a special property.

**Perpendicular lines** form a right angle. The product of their slopes is –1.

$$
m_1 \cdot m_2=-1
$$

**Example 2:** Verify that the following lines are perpendicular.

_Line_ $a$: passes through points (–2, –7) and (1, 5)

_Line_ $b$: passes through points (4, 1) and (–8, 4)

**Solution:** Find the slopes of each line.

$$
\begin{align*}
Line \ a: \frac{5-(-7)}{1-(-2)}=\frac{12}{3}=\frac{4}{1} && Line \ b: \frac{4-1}{-8-4}=\frac{3}{-12}=\frac{-1}{4}
\end{align*}
$$

To verify that the lines are perpendicular, the product of their slopes must equal –1.

$$
\frac{4}{1} \times \frac{-1}{4}=-1
$$

Because the product of their slopes is $-1$, lines $a$ and $b$ are perpendicular.

**Example 3:** Determine whether the two lines are parallel, perpendicular, or neither:

Line 1: $2x=y-10$; Line 2: $y=-2x+5$

**Solution:** Begin by finding the slopes of lines 1 and 2.

$$
\begin{align*}
2x+10& =y-10+10\\
2x+10& =y
\end{align*}
$$

The slope of the first line is 2.

$$
y=-2x+5
$$

The slope of the second line is –2.

These slopes are not identical, so these lines are not parallel.

To check if the lines are perpendicular, find the product of the slopes. $2 \times -2=-4$. The product of the slopes is not –1, so the lines are not perpendicular.

Lines 1 and 2 are neither parallel nor perpendicular.

Writing Equations of Parallel Lines
-----------------------------------

**Example 4:** _Find the equation parallel to the line $y=6x-9$ passing through (–1, 4)_.

**Solution:** Parallel lines have the same slope, so the slope will be 6. You have a point and the slope, so you can use point-slope form.

$$
\begin{align*}
y-y_1& =m(x-x_1)\\
y-4& =6(x+1)
\end{align*}
$$

You could rewrite it in slope-intercept form:

$$
\begin{align*}
y& =6x+6+4\\
y& =6x+10
\end{align*}
$$

Writing Equations of Perpendicular Lines
----------------------------------------

Writing equations of perpendicular lines is slightly more difficult than writing parallel line equations. The reason is because you must find the slope of the perpendicular line before you can proceed with writing an equation.

Example: _Find the equation perpendicular to the line $y=-3x+5$ that passes through point (2, 6)._

Solution: Begin by finding the slopes of the perpendicular line. Using the perpendicular line definition, $m_1 \cdot m_2=-1$. The slope of the original line is –3. Substitute that for $m_1$.

$$
-3 \cdot m_2=-1
$$

Solve for $m_2$, the slope of the perpendicular line.

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{-3m_2}{-3}& =\frac{-1}{-3}\\
m_2& =\frac{1}{3}
\end{align*}
$$

The slope of the line perpendicular to $y=-3x+5$ is $\frac{1}{3}$.

You now have the slope and a point. Use point-slope form to write its equation.

$$
y-6= \frac{1}{3}(x-2)
$$

You can rewrite this in slope-intercept form: $y=\frac{1}{3} x-\frac{2}{3}+6$.

$$
y=\frac{1}{3} x+\frac{16}{3}
$$

**Example 4:** _Find the equation of the line perpendicular to the line $y=5$ and passing through (5, 4)._

**Solution:** The line $y=5$ is a horizontal line with slope of zero. The only thing that makes a $90^\circ$ angle with a horizontal line is a vertical line. Vertical lines have undefined slopes.

Since the vertical line must go through (5, 4), the equation is $x=5$.

Families of Lines
-----------------

A straight line has two very important properties, its **slope** and its $y-$**intercept**. The slope tells us how steeply the line rises or falls, and the $y-$intercept tells us where the line intersects the $y-$axis. In this section, we will look at two families of lines.

A **family of lines** is a set of lines that have something in common with each other. Straight lines can belong to two types of families: where the slope is the same and where the $y-$intercept is the same.

Family 1: The slope is the same
-------------------------------

Remember that lines with the same slope are parallel. Each line on the Cartesian plane below has an identical slope with different $y-$intercepts. All the lines look the same but they are shifted up and down the $y-$axis. As $b$ gets larger the line rises on the $y-$axis and as $b$ gets smaller the line goes lower on the $y-$axis. This behavior is often called a **vertical shift**.

![0](media/167.png "Figure 2: Family 2: The $y-$intercept is the same")
---------------------------------------

The graph below shows several lines with the same $y-$intercept but varying slopes.

### 5.5 Fitting a Line to Data

<article>

The real-world situations you have been studying so far form linear equations. However, most data in life is messy and does not fit a line in slope-intercept form with 100% accuracy. Because of this tendency, people spend their entire career attempting to fit lines to data. The equations that are created to fit the data are used to make predictions, as you will see in the next lesson.

This lesson focuses on graphing **scatter plots** and using the scatter plot to find a linear equation that will best fit the data.

A **scatter plot** is a plot of all the ordered pairs in the table. This means that a scatter plot is a relation, and not necessarily a function. Also, the scatter plot is **discrete**, as it is a set of distinct points. Even when we expect the relationship we are analyzing to be linear, we should not expect that all the points would fit perfectly on a straight line. Rather, the points will be “scattered” about a straight line. There are many reasons why the data does not fall perfectly on a line. Such reasons include **measurement errors** and **outliers**.

**Measurement error** is the amount you are off by reading a ruler or graph.

An **outlier** is a data point that does not fit with the general pattern of the data. It tends to be “outside” the majority of the scatter plot.

Example: _Make a scatter plot of the following ordered pairs._

(0, 2), (1, 4.5), (2, 9), (3, 11), (4, 13), (5, 18), (6, 19.5)

Solution: Graph each ordered pair on one Cartesian plane.

![0](media/170.png "Figure 1: Fitting a Line to Data")
----------------------

Notice that the points graphed on the plane above look like they might be part of a straight line, although they would not fit perfectly. If the points were perfectly lined up, it would be quite easy to draw a line through all of them and find the equation of that line. However, if the points are “scattered,” we try to find a line that best fits the data. The graph below shows several potential **lines of best fit**.

![0](media/171.png "Figure 2: You see that we can draw many lines through the points in our data set. These lines have equations that are very different from each other. We want to use the line that is closest to **all** the points on the graph. The best candidate in our graph is the red line $A$. Line $A$ is the **line of best fit** for this scatter plot.")

Writing Equations for Lines of Best Fit
---------------------------------------

Once you have decided upon your line of best fit, you need to write its equation by finding two points on it and using either:

* Point-slope form;
* Standard form; or
* Slope-intercept form.

The form you use will depend upon the situation and the ease of finding the $y-$intercept.

Using the red line from the example above, locate two points on the line.

![0](media/172.png "Figure 3: Find the slope: $m=\frac{11-4.5}{3-1}=\frac{6.5}{2}=3.25$.")

Then $y=3.25x+b$.

Substitute (3, 11) into the equation. $11=3.25(3)+b \Rightarrow b = 1.25$

The equation for the line that fits the data best is $y=3.25x+1.25$.

Finding Equations for Lines of Best Fit Using a Calculator
----------------------------------------------------------

Graphing calculators can make writing equations of best fit easier and more accurate. Two people working with the same data might get two different equations because they would be drawing different lines. To get the most accurate equation for the line, we can use a graphing calculator. The calculator uses a mathematical algorithm to find the line that minimizes error between the data points and the line of best fit.

Example: _Use a graphing calculator to find the equation of the line of best fit for the following data:_ (3, 12), (8, 20), (1, 7), (10, 23), (5, 18), (8, 24), (11, 30), (2, 10).

Solution:

**Step 1:** _Input the data in your calculator_. Press **\[STAT\]** and choose the **\[EDIT\]** option.

![0](media/173.png "Figure 4: Input the data into the table by entering the $x$ values in the first column and the $y$ values in the second column.")

**Step 2:** _Find the equation of the line of best fit._

![0](media/174.png "Figure 5: Press **\[STAT\]** again and use the right arrow to select **\[CALC\]** at the top of the screen.")

Chose option number 4: $LinReg(ax+b)$ and press **\[ENTER\]**. The calculator will display $LinReg(ax+b)$.

![0](media/175.png "Figure 6: Press **\[ENTER\]** and you will be given the $a$ and $b$ values.")

Here $a$ represents the slope and $b$ represents the $y-$intercept of the equation. The linear regression line is $y=2.01x+5.94$.

**Step 3:** _Draw the scatter plot._

![0](media/176.png "Figure 7: To draw the scatter plot press **\[STATPLOT\] \[2nd\] \[Y=\]**.")

Choose Plot 1 and press **\[ENTER\]**.

Press the **On** option and choose the Type as scatter plot (the one highlighted in black).

Make sure that the $X$ list and $Y$ list names match the names of the columns of the table in Step 1.

![0](media/177.png "Figure 8: Choose the box or plus as the mark since the simple dot may make it difficult to see the points.")

Press **\[GRAPH\]** and adjust the window size so you can see all the points in the scatter plot.

**Step 4:** _Draw the line of best fit through the scatter plot._

Press **\[Y=\]**.

Enter the equation of the line of best fit that you just found: $Y_1 = 2.01X+5.94$.

Press **\[GRAPH\]**.

![0](media/178.png "Figure 9: Using Lines of Best Fit to Solve Situations")
-------------------------------------------

Example: _Gal is training for a 5K race (a total of 5000 meters, or about 3.1 miles). The following table shows her times for each month of her training program. Assume here that her times will decrease in a straight line with time. Find an equation of a line of fit. Predict her running time if her race is in August._

![0](media/179.png "Figure 10: | **Month** | **Month number** | **Average time (minutes)** |")
| --- | --- | --- |
| January | 0   | 40  |
| February | 1   | 38  |
| March | 2   | 39  |
| April | 3   | 38  |
| May | 4   | 33  |
| June | 5   | 30  |

Solution: Begin by making a scatter plot of Gal’s running times. The independent variable, $x$, is the month number and the dependent variable, $y$, is the running time in minutes. Plot all the points in the table on the coordinate plane.

![0](media/180.png "Figure 11: Draw a line of fit.")

Choose two points on the line (0, 41) and (4, 34).

Find the equation of the line.

$$
\begin{align*}
m&=\frac{34-41}{4-0}=-\frac{7}{4}=-1\frac{3}{4}\\
y&=-\frac{7}{4}x+b\\
41&=-\frac{7}{4}(0)+b \Rightarrow b=41\\
y&=-\frac{7}{4}x+41
\end{align*}
$$

In a real-world problem, the slope and $y-$intercept have a physical significance.

![0](media/181.png "Figure 12: $$")
\text{Slope} = \frac{number \ of \ minutes}{month}
$$

Since the slope is negative, the number of minutes Gal spends running a 5K race decreases as the months pass. The slope tells us that Gal’s running time decreases 1.75 minutes per month.

The $y-$intercept tells us that when Gal started training, she ran a distance of 5K in 41 minutes, which is just an estimate, since the actual time was 40 minutes.

The problem asks us to predict Gal’s running time in August. Since June is assigned to month number five, then August will be month number seven. Substitute $x=7$ into the line of best fit equation.

$$
y=-\frac{7}{4}(7)+41 = -\frac{49}{4}+41=-\frac{49}{4}+\frac{164}{4}=\frac{115}{4}=28\frac{3}{4}
$$

The equation predicts that Gal will be running the 5K race in 28.75 minutes.

### 5.6 Predicting with Linear Models

<article>

Numerical information appears in all areas of life. You can find it in newspapers, in magazines, in journals, on the television, or on the Internet. In the last lesson, you saw how to find the equation of a line of best fit. Using a line of best fit is a good method if the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear. Not all data fits a straight line, though. This lesson will show other methods to help estimate data values. These methods are useful in both linear and non-linear relationships.

Linear Interpolation
--------------------

**Linear interpolation** is useful when looking for a value between given data points. It can be considered as “filling in the gaps” of a table of data.

The strategy for linear interpolation is to use a straight line to connect the known data points on either side of the unknown point. Linear interpolation is often not accurate for non-linear data. If the points in the data set change by a large amount, linear interpolation may not give a good estimate.

Linear Extrapolation
--------------------

Linear extrapolation can help us estimate values that are either higher or lower than the values in the data set. Think of this as “the long-term estimate” of the data.

The strategy for linear extrapolation is to use a subset of the data instead of the entire data set. This is especially true for non-linear data you will encounter in later chapters. For this type of data, it is sometimes useful to extrapolate using the last two or three data points in order to estimate a value higher than the data range.

Collecting and Organizing Data
------------------------------

Data can be collected through various means, including surveys or experiments.

A **survey** is a data collection method used to gather information about individuals’ opinions, beliefs, or habits.

The information collected by the U.S. Census Bureau or the Center for Disease Control are examples of data gathered using surveys. The U.S. Census Bureau collects information about many aspects of the U.S. population.

An **experiment** is a controlled test or investigation.

Let’s say we are interested in how the median age for first marriages has changed during the $20^{th}$ century. The U.S. Census provides the following information about the median age at first marriage for males and females. Below is the table of data and its corresponding scatter plot.

![0](media/182.png "Figure 1: | **Year** | **Median Age of Males** | **Median Age of Females** |")
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1890 | 26.1 | 22.0 |
| 1900 | 25.9 | 21.9 |
| 1910 | 25.1 | 21.6 |
| 1920 | 24.6 | 21.2 |
| 1930 | 24.3 | 21.3 |
| 1940 | 24.3 | 21.5 |
| 1950 | 22.8 | 20.3 |
| 1960 | 22.8 | 20.3 |
| 1970 | 23.2 | 20.8 |
| 1980 | 24.7 | 22.0 |
| 1990 | 26.1 | 23.9 |
| 2000 | 26.8 | 25.1 |

**Median Age of Males and Females at First Marriage by Year**

![0](media/183.png "Figure 2: Example: _Estimate the median age for the first marriage of a male in the year 1946_.")

Solution: We will first use the method of interpolation because there is a “gap” needing to be filled. 1946 is between 1940 and 1950, so these are the data points we will use.

![0](media/184.png "Figure 3: By connecting the two points, an equation can be found.")

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Slope} && m & = \frac{22.8 - 24.3}{1950 - 1940} = \frac{-1.5}{10}=-0.15\\
&& y& =-0.15x+b\\
&& 24.3 & = -0.15(1940)+b\\
&& b & = 315.3\\
\text{Equation} && y&=-0.15x+315.3
\end{align*}
$$

To estimate the median age of marriage of males in year 1946, substitute $x=1946$ in the equation.

$$
y=-0.15(1946)+315.3=23.4 \ years \ old
$$

Example: _The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has the following information regarding the percentage of pregnant women smokers organized by year. Estimate the percentage of pregnant women that were smoking in the year 1998_.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |Percent of Pregnant Women Smokers by Year
| **Year** | **Percent** |
| --- | --- |
| 1990 | 18.4 |
| 1991 | 17.7 |
| 1992 | 16.9 |
| 1993 | 15.8 |
| 1994 | 14.6 |
| 1995 | 13.9 |
| 1996 | 13.6 |
| 2000 | 12.2 |
| 2002 | 11.4 |
| 2003 | 10.4 |
| 2004 | 10.2 |

**Percent of Pregnant Women Smokers by Year**

![0](media/185.png "Figure 4: Solution: We want to use the information close to 1998 to **interpolate** the data. We do this by connecting the points on either side of 1998 with a straight line and find the equation of that line.")

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Slope} && m&=\frac{12.2-13.6}{2000-1996}=\frac{-1.4}{4}=-0.35\\
&& y& =-0.35x + b\\
&& 12.2 & = -0.35(2000)+b\\
&& b& =712.2\\
\text{Equation} && y& =-0.35x+712.2
\end{align*}
$$

To estimate the percentage of pregnant women who smoked in year 1998, substitute $x=1998$ into the equation.

$$
y=-0.35(1998)+712.2=12.9\%
$$

Predicting Using an Equation
----------------------------

When linear interpolation and linear extrapolation do not produce accurate predictions, using the line of best fit (**linear regression**) may be the best choice. The “by hand” and calculator methods of determining the line of best fit were presented in the last lesson.

Example: The winning times for the women’s 100-meter race are given in the following table. Estimate the winning time in the year 2010. Is this a good estimate?

| **Winner** | **Ctry.** | **Year** | **Seconds** | **Winner** | **Ctry.** | **Year** | **Seconds** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mary Lines | UK  | 1922 | 12.8 | Vera Krepkina | Sov. | 1958 | 11.3 |
| Leni Schmidt | Germ. | 1925 | 12.4 | Wyomia Tyus | USA | 1964 | 11.2 |
| Gertrurd Glasitsch | Germ. | 1927 | 12.1 | Barbara Ferrell | USA | 1968 | 11.1 |
| Tollien Schuurman | Neth. | 1930 | 12.0 | Ellen Strophal | E. Germ. | 1972 | 11.0 |
| Helen Stephens | USA | 1935 | 11.8 | Inge Helten | W. Germ. | 1975 | 11.0 |
| Lulu Mae Hymes | USA | 1939 | 11.5 | Marlies Gohr | E. Germ. | 1982 | 10.9 |
| Fanny Blankers-Koen | Neth. | 1943 | 11.5 | Florence Griffith Joyner | USA | 1988 | 10.5 |
| Marjorie Jackson | Austr. | 1952 | 11.4 |     |     |     |     |

Solution: Start by making a scatter plot of the data. Connect the last two points on the graph and find the equation of the line.

**Winning Times for the Women’s 100-meter Race by Year**

$^3 \text{Source}$: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Record_progression_100_m_women.

![0](media/186.png "Figure 5: $$")
\begin{align*}
\text{Slope} && m & =\frac{10.5 - 10.9}{1988-1982}=\frac{-0.4}{6}=-0.067\\
&& y& =-0.067x+b\\
&& 10.5& =-0.067(1988)+b\\
&& b& =143.7\\
\text{Equation} && y & =-0.067x+143.7
\end{align*}
$$

The winning time in year 2010 is estimated to be: $y=-0.067(2010)+143.7=\underline{9.03 \ \text{seconds}}$.

How accurate is this estimate? It is likely that it's not very accurate because 2010 is a long time from 1988. This example demonstrates the weakness of linear extrapolation. Estimates given by linear extrapolation are never as good as using the equation from the line of best fit method. In this particular example, the last data point clearly does not fit in with the general trend of the data so the slope of the extrapolation line is much steeper than it should be.

As a historical note, the last data point corresponds to the winning time for Florence Griffith Joyner in 1988. After her race, she was accused of using performance-enhancing drugs but this fact was never proven. In addition, there is a question about the accuracy of the timing because some officials said that the tail wind was not accounted for in this race even though all the other races of the day were impacted by a strong wind.

### 5.7 Problem-Solving Strategies: Use a Linear Model

<article>

This chapter has focused on writing equations and determining lines of best fit. When we fit a line to data using interpolation, extrapolation, or linear regression, it is called **linear modeling.**

A **model** is an equation that best describes the data graphed in the scatter plot.

**Example 1**: _Dana heard something very interesting at school. Her teacher told her that if you divide the circumference of a circle by its diameter you always get the same number. She tested this statement by measuring the circumference and diameter of several circular objects. The following table shows her results._

From this data, estimate the circumference of a circle whose diameter is 12 inches. What about 25 inches? 60 inches?

Solution: Begin by creating a scatter plot and drawing the line of best fit.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |Diameter and Circumference of Various Objects
| **Object** | **Diameter (inches)** | **Circumference (inches)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Table | 53  | 170 |
| Soda can | 2.25 | 7.1 |
| Cocoa tin | 4.2 | 12.6 |
| Plate | 8   | 25.5 |
| Straw | 0.25 | 1.2 |
| Propane tank | 13.3 | 39.6 |
| Hula hoop | 34.25 | 115 |

![0](media/187.png "Figure 1: Find the equation of the line of best fit using points (0.25, 1.2) and (8, 25.5).")

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{Slope} && m = \frac{25.5 - 12}{8 - 0.25} = \frac{24.3}{7.75} = 3.14\\
&&& y = 3.14x + b\\
&&&1.2 = 3.14(0.25) + b \Rightarrow b = 0.42\\
&\text{Equation} && y = 3.14x + 0.42
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{Diameter} = 12 \ \text{inches} \Rightarrow y = 3.14 (12) + 0.42 = \underline{38.1 \ \text{inches}}\\
&\text{Diameter} = 25 \ \text{inches} \Rightarrow y = 3.14 (25) + 0.42 = \underline{78.92 \ \text{inches}}\\
&\text{Diameter} = 60 \ \text{inches} \Rightarrow y = 3.14 (60) + 0.42 = \underline{188.82 \ \text{inches}}
\end{align*}
$$

In this problem, the $\text{slope} = 3.14$. This number should be very familiar to you—it is the number _pi_ rounded to the hundredths place. Theoretically, the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter is always the same and it equals 3.14 or $\pi$.

**Example 2**: _A cylinder is filled with water to a height of 73 centimeters. The water is drained through a hole in the bottom of the cylinder and measurements are taken at two-second intervals. The table below shows the height of the water level in the cylinder at different times._

_Find the water level at 15 seconds._

Solution: Begin by graphing the scatter plot. As you can see below, a straight line does not fit the majority of this data. Therefore, there is no line of best fit. Instead, use interpolation.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |Water Level in Cylinder at Various Times
| **Time (seconds)** | **Water level (cm)** |
| --- | --- |
| 0.0 | 73  |
| 2.0 | 63.9 |
| 4.0 | 55.5 |
| 6.0 | 47.2 |
| 8.0 | 40.0 |
| 10.0 | 33.4 |
| 12.0 | 27.4 |
| 14.0 | 21.9 |
| 16.0 | 17.1 |
| 18.0 | 12.9 |
| 20.0 | 9.4 |
| 22.0 | 6.3 |
| 24.0 | 3.9 |
| 26.0 | 2.0 |
| 28.0 | 0.7 |
| 30.0 | 0.1 |

![0](media/188.png "Figure 2: ![0](media/189.png)")

\[Figure 3\]

To find the value at 15 seconds, connect points (14, 21.9) and (16, 17.1) and find the equation of the straight line.

$$
m=\frac{17.1-21.9}{16-14}=\frac{-4.8}{2}=-2.4
$$

$$
y=-2.4x+b \Rightarrow 21.9 = -2.4(14)+b \Rightarrow b =55.5
$$

Equation $y=-2.4x+55.5$

Substitute $x=15$ and obtain $y=-2.4(15)+55.5=19.5 \ cm$.

### 5.8 Problem-Solving Strategies: Dimensional Analysis

<article>

Real-world information is given in **dimensions**, or the units in which the value is measured. For example, the following are all examples of dimensions.

* Inches
* Feet
* Liters
* Micrograms
* Acres
* Hours
* Pounds
* Students

Analyzing dimensions can help you solve problems in travel, astronomy, physics, engineering, forensics, and quality. Solving problems by converting dimensions or canceling dimensions is the focus of this lesson.

![0](media/190.png "Figure 1: ![0](media/191.png)")

\[Figure 2\]

Consider the distance formula $distance=rate \ \cdot \ time$. This formula can be rewritten for _rate_. $rate=\frac{distance}{time}$. If _distance_ is measured in kilometers, and _time_ is measured in hours, the rate would have the dimensions $\frac{kilometers}{hours}$.

You can treat dimensions as variables. Identical units can divide out, or cancel. For example, $\frac{kilometers}{hour} \cdot hour \rightarrow \frac{kilometers}{\cancel{hour}} \cdot \cancel{hour} \rightarrow kilometers$.

Sometimes the units will not divide out. In this case, a **conversion factor** is needed.

**Example**: _Convert_ $\frac{35 \ kilometers}{hour}$ _to meters_.

Solution: Since _kilometers_ $\neq$ _meters_, you need to **convert** kilometers to meters to get the answer. You know there are 1,000 meters in a kilometer. Therefore, you will need to multiply the original dimension by this factor.

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{35 \ kilometers}{hour} \cdot \frac{1000 \ meters}{1 \ kilometer} \cdot hour \rightarrow \frac{35 \ \cancel{kilometers}}{\cancel{hour}} \cdot \frac{1000 \ meters}{1 \ \cancel{kilometer}} \cdot \cancel{hour} & = 35(1000)meters.\\
\frac{35\ kilometers}{hour}& =35,000 \ meters
\end{align*}
$$

The process of using units or dimensions to help solve a problem is called **dimensional analysis**. It is very useful in chemistry and travel, as shown in the examples below.

**Example**: _How many seconds are in a month?_

Solution: This situation can be solved easily using multiplication. However, the process you use when multiplying the values together is an example of dimensional analysis.

Begin with what you know:

* 60 seconds in one minute
* 60 minutes in one hour
* 24 hours in one day
* Approximately 30 days in one month

![0](media/192.png "Figure 3: Now write the expression to convert the seconds in one minute to one month.")

$$
\frac{60 \ seconds}{1 \ minute} \cdot \frac{60 \ minutes}{1 \ hour} \cdot \frac{24 \ hours}{1 \ day} \cdot \frac{30 \ days}{1 \ month}
$$

Identical units cross-cancel.

$$
\frac{60 \ seconds}{1 \ \cancel{minute}} \cdot \frac{60 \ \cancel{minutes}}{1 \ \cancel{hour}} \cdot \frac{24 \ \cancel{hours}}{1 \ \cancel{day}} \cdot \frac{30 \ \cancel{days}}{1 \ month}
$$

Multiply the fractions together.

$$
\frac{60 \cdot 60 \cdot 24 \cdot 30 \ seconds}{1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \ month}=2,592,000\frac{seconds}{month}
$$

**Example 1:** _How many grams are in 5 pounds?_

**Solution:** Begin by writing all the conversions you know related to this situation.

$$
\begin{align*}
1 \ gram & \approx 0.0353 \ ounces\\
16 \ ounces & = 1 \ pound
\end{align*}
$$

Write your dimensional analysis.

$$
5 \ pounds \cdot \frac{16 \ ounces}{1 \ pound} \cdot \frac{1 \ gram}{0.0353 \ ounce}
$$

Cross-cancel identical units and multiply.

$$
5 \ \cancel{pounds} \cdot \frac{16 \ \cancel{ounces}}{1 \ \cancel{pound}} \cdot \frac{1 \ gram}{0.0353 \ \cancel{ounce}}=2226.29 \ grams
$$

A long list of conversion factors can be found at this website.

## 6.0 Linear Inequalities and Absolute Value; An Introduction to Probability

<article>

This chapter moves beyond equations to the study of inequalities. Many situations have more than one correct answer. A police officer can issue a ticket for any speed exceeding the limit. A rider for the bumper boats must be less than 48 inches tall. Both these situations have many possible answers.

### 6.1 Inequalities Using Addition and Subtraction

<article>

Verbs that translate into inequalities are:

$>$ “greater than”

$\ge$ “greater than or equal to”

$<$ “less than”

$\le$ “less than or equal to”

$\neq$ “not equal to”

**Definition:** An **algebraic inequality** is a mathematical sentence connecting an expression to a value, a variable, or another expression with an inequality sign.

Solutions to one-variable inequalities can be graphed on a number line or in a coordinate plane.

**Example:** _Graph the solutions to $t > 3$ on a number line._

**Solution:** The inequality is asking for all real numbers larger than 3.

![0](media/194.png "Figure 1: You can also write inequalities given a number line of solutions.")

**Example:** _Write the inequality pictured below._

![0](media/195.png "Figure 2: **Solution:** The value of four is colored in, meaning that four is a solution to the inequality. The red arrow indicates values less than four. Therefore, the inequality is:")

$$
x \le 4
$$

Inequalities that “include” the value are shown as $\le$ or $\ge$. The line underneath the inequality stands for “or equal to.” We show this relationship by coloring in the circle above this value on the number line, as in the previous example. For inequalities without the “or equal to,” the circle above the value on the number line remains unfilled.

Four Ways to Express Solutions to Inequalities
----------------------------------------------

1. Inequality notation: The answer is expressed as an algebraic inequality, such as $d \le \frac{1}{2}$.

2. Set notation: The inequality is rewritten using set notation brackets { }. For example, $\left \{ d | d \le \frac{1}{2} \right \}$ is read, “The set of all values of $d$, such that $d$ is a real number less than or equal to one-half.”

3. Interval notation: This notation uses brackets to denote the range of values in an inequality.

1.  Square or “closed” brackets \[ \] indicate that the number is **included** in the solution
2.  Round or “open” brackets ( ) indicate that the number is **not included** in the solution.

Interval notation also uses the concept of infinity $\infty$ and negative infinity $- \infty$. For example, for all values of $d$ that are less than or equal to $\frac{1}{2}$, you could use set notation as follows: $\left . \left (-\infty, \frac{1}{2}\right \} \right .$.

4. As a graphed sentence on a number line.

**Example:** (8, 24) states that the solution is all numbers between 8 and 24 but **does not include** the numbers 8 and 24.

\[3, 12) states that the solution is all numbers between 3 and 12, **including** 3 but **not including** 12.

Inequalities Using Addition or Subtraction
------------------------------------------

To solve inequalities, you need some properties.

**Addition Property of Inequality:** For all real numbers $a, \ b,$ and $c$:

_If_ $x < a$, _then_ $x + b < a + b$.

_If_ $x < a$, _then_ $x - c < a - c$.

The two properties above are also true for $\le$ or $\ge$.

Because subtraction can also be thought of as **“add the opposite,”** these properties also work for subtraction situations.

Just like one-step equations, the goal is to **isolate the variable,** meaning to get the variable alone on one side of the inequality symbol. To do this, you will cancel the operations using inverses.

**Example:** _Solve for_ $x:\ x - 3 < 10$.

**Solution:** To isolate the variable $x$, you must cancel “subtract 3” using its inverse operation, addition.

$$
\begin{align*}
x-3+3 &< 10 + 3\\
x &< 13
\end{align*}
$$

Now, check your answer. Choose a number less than 13 and substitute it into your original inequality. If you choose 0, and substitute it you get:

$$
0 - 3 < 10 = -3 < 10
$$

What happens at 13? What happens with numbers greater than 13?

**Example:** _Solve for_ $x: \ x + 4 > 13$

**Solution:**

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{To solve the inequality} && x + 4 &> 13\\
\text{Subtract 4 from both sides of the inequality.} && x + 4 - 4 &> 13 - 4\\
\text{Simplify.} && x &> 9
\end{align*}
$$

![0](media/196.png "Figure 3: Writing Real-Life Inequalities")
------------------------------

As described in the chapter opener, inequalities appear frequently in real life. Solving inequalities is an important part of algebra.

**Example:** Write the following statement as an algebraic inequality. You must maintain a balance of at least $2,500 in your checking account to avoid a finance charge.

**Solution:** The key phrase in this statement is “at least.” This means you can have $2,500 or more in your account to avoid a finance charge.

Choose the variable to describe the money in your account, say $m$.

Write the inequality: $m \ge 2500$.

Graph the solutions using a number line.

![0](media/197.png "Figure 4: **Example:** _Translate into an algebraic inequality:_ “The speed limit is 65 miles per hour.”")

**Solution:** To avoid a ticket, you must drive 65 or less. Choose a variable to describe your possible speed, say $s.$

Write the inequality $s \le 65.$

Graph the solutions to the inequality using a number line.

![0](media/198.png "Figure 5: In theory, you cannot drive a negative number of miles per hour. This concept will be a focus later in this chapter.")

### 6.2 Inequalities Using Multiplication and Division

<article>

Equations are mathematical sentences in which the two sides have the same “weight.” By adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing the same value to both sides of the equation, the balance stays in check. However, inequalities begin off-balance. When you perform inverse operations, the inequality will remain off-balance. This is true with inequalities involving both multiplication and division.

Before we can begin to solve inequalities involving multiplication or division, you need to know two properties, the Multiplication Property of Inequalities and the Division Property of Inequalities.

**Multiplication Property of Inequality:** For all real positive numbers $a, \ b,$ and $c$:

_If_ $x < a$, _then_ $x(c)< a(c).$

_If_ $x > a$, _then_ $x(c) > a(c).$

**Division Property of Inequality:** For all real positive numbers $a, \ b,$ and $c$:

_If_ $x < a$, _then_ $x \div (c) < a \div (c).$

_If_ $x > a$, _then_ $x \div (c) > a \div (c).$

Consider the inequality $2x \ge 12$. To find the solutions to this inequality, we must isolate the variable $x$ by using the inverse operation of “multiply by 2,” which is dividing by 2.

$$
\begin{align*}
2x & \ge 12\\
\frac{2x}{2} & \ge \frac{12}{2}\\
x & \ge 6
\end{align*}
$$

This solution can be expressed in four ways. One way is already written, $x \ge 6$. Below are the three remaining ways to express this solution:

* $\left \{ x | x \ge 6 \right \}$
* $[6, \infty)$
* Using a number line: ![0](media/207.png)
    
    \[Figure 1\]
    

**Example:** _Solve for_ $y: \frac{y}{5} \le 3$. _Express the solution using all four methods._

**Solution:** The inequality above is read, “$y$ divided by 5 is less than or equal to 3.” To isolate the variable $y$, you must cancel division using its inverse operation, multiplication.

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{y}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{1} & \le 3 \cdot \frac{5}{1}\\
y & \le 15
\end{align*}
$$

One method of writing the solution is $y \le 15.$

The other three are:

* $(-\infty ,15]$
* $\left \{ y | y \le 15 \right \}$
* ![0](media/208.png)
    
    \[Figure 2\]
    

Multiplying and Dividing an Inequality by a Negative Number
-----------------------------------------------------------

Notice that the two properties in this lesson focused on $c$ being only positive. This is because those particular properties of multiplication and division do not apply when the number being multiplied (or divided) is negative.

Think of it this way. When you multiply a value by –1, the number you get is the negative of the original.

$$
6(-1)=-6
$$

Multiplying each side of a sentence by –1 results in the opposite of both values.

$$
\begin{align*}
5x(-1)&=4(-1)\\
-5x&=-4
\end{align*}
$$

When multiplying by a negative, you are doing the “opposite” of everything in the sentence, including the verb.

$$
\begin{align*}
x&>4\\
x(-1)&>4(-1)\\
-x&<-4
\end{align*}
$$

This concept is summarized below.

**Multiplication/Division Rule of Inequality:** For any real number $a$, and any **negative** number $c$,

_If_ $x<a$, _then_ $x \cdot c > a \cdot c$

_If_ $x<a$, _then_ $\frac{x}{c} > \frac{a}{c}$

As with the other properties of inequalities, these also hold true for $\le$ _or_ $\ge$.

**Example 1:** _Solve for_ $r: -3r < 9$.

**Solution:** To isolate the variable $r$, we must cancel “multiply by –3” using its inverse operation, dividing by –3.

$$
\frac{-3r}{-3} < \frac{9}{-3}
$$

Since you are dividing by –3, everything becomes opposite, including the inequality sign.

$$
r > -3
$$

**Example 2:** _Solve for_ $p: 12p < -30$.

**Solution:** To isolate the variable $p$, we must cancel “multiply by 12” using its inverse operation, dividing by 12.

$$
\frac{12p}{12} < \frac{-30}{12}
$$

Because 12 is **not** negative, you do **not** switch the inequality sign.

$$
p < \frac{-5}{2}
$$

.

In set notation, the solution would be: $\left ( -\infty, \frac{-5}{2} \right )$

### 6.3 Multi-Step Inequalities

<article>

The previous two lessons focused on one-step inequalities. Inequalities, like equations, can require several steps to isolate the variable. These inequalities are called **multi-step inequalities.** With the exception of the Multiplication/Division Property of Inequality, the process of solving multi-step inequalities is identical to solving multi-step equations.

**Procedure to Solve an Inequality:**

1.  Remove any parentheses by using the Distributive Property.
2.  Simplify each side of the inequality by combining like terms.
3.  Isolate the $ax$ term. Use the Addition/Subtraction Property of Inequality to get the variable on one side of the inequality sign and the numerical values on the other.
4.  Isolate the variable. Use the Multiplication/Division Property of Inequality to get the variable alone on one side of the inequality.
    1.  Remember to reverse the inequality sign if you are multiplying or dividing by a negative number.
5.  Check your solution.

**Example:** _Solve for_ $w: \ 6x-5<10$.

**Solution:** Begin by using the checklist above.

1. Parentheses? No

2. Like terms on the same side of inequality? No

3. Isolate the $ax$ term using the Addition Property.

$$
6x-5+5<10+5
$$

Simplify.

$$
6x<15
$$

4. Isolate the variable using the Multiplication or Division Property.

$$
\frac{6x}{6} < \frac{15}{6} = x < \frac{5}{2}
$$

5. Check your solution. Choose a number less than 2.5, say 0, and check using the original inequality.

$$
\begin{align*}
6(0)-5 &< 10?\\
-5 & < 10
\end{align*}
$$

Yes, the answer checks. $x < 2.5$

**Example:** _Solve for_ $x: \ -9x<-5x-15$

**Solution:** Begin by using the checklist above.

1. Parentheses? No

2. Like terms on the same side of inequality? No

3. Isolate the $ax$ term using the Addition Property.

$$
-9x+5x<-5x+5x-15
$$

Simplify.

$$
-4x<-15
$$

4. Isolate the variable using the Multiplication or Division Property.

$$
\frac{-4x}{-4} < \frac{-15}{-4}
$$

Because the number you are dividing by is negative, you must reverse the inequality sign.

$$
x>\frac{15}{4}  \rightarrow x > 3 \frac{3}{4}
$$

5. Check your solution by choosing a number larger than 3.75, say 10.

$$
\begin{align*}
-9(10)& <-5(10)-15?\\
\checkmark \ -90 & <-65
\end{align*}
$$

**Example:** _Solve for_ $x: \ 4x-2(3x-9) \le -4(2x-9)$.

**Solution:** Begin by using the previous checklist.

1. Parentheses? Yes. Use the Distributive Property to clear the parentheses.

$$
4x+(-2)(3x)+(-2)(-9)\le-4(2x)+(-4)(-9)
$$

Simplify.

$$
4x-6x+18 \le -8x+36
$$

2. Like terms on the same side of inequality? Yes. Combine these.

$$
-2x+18\le-8x+36
$$

3. Isolate the $ax$ term using the Addition Property.

$$
-2x+8x+18\le-8x+8x+36
$$

Simplify.

$$
\begin{align*}
6x+18 & \le36\\
6x+18-18 & \le36-18\\
6x & \le18
\end{align*}
$$

4. Isolate the variable using the Multiplication or Division Property.

$$
\frac{6x}{6} \le \frac{18}{6} \rightarrow x \le 3
$$

5. Check your solution by choosing a number less than 3, say –5.

$$
\begin{align*}
4(-5)-2(3 \cdot -5-9) & \le -4(2 \cdot -5-9)\\
\checkmark \ 28 & <76
\end{align*}
$$

Identifying the Number of Solutions to an Inequality
----------------------------------------------------

Inequalities can have infinitely many solutions, no solutions, or a finite set of solutions. Most of the inequalities you have solved to this point have an infinite amount of solutions. By solving inequalities and using the context of a problem, you can determine the number of solutions an inequality may have.

**Example:** Find the solutions to $x-5>x+6$.

**Solution:** Begin by isolating the variable using the Addition Property of Inequality.

$$
x-x-5>x-x+6
$$

Simplify.

$$
-5>6
$$

This is an untrue inequality. Negative five is never greater than six. Therefore, the inequality $x-5>x+6$ has no solutions.

Previously we looked at the following sentence: “The speed limit is 65 miles per hour.”

The algebraic sentence for this situation is: $s \le 65.$

**Example:** Find the solutions to $s \le 65.$

**Solution:** The speed at which you drive cannot be negative. Therefore, the set of possibilities using interval notation is \[0, 65\].

Solving Real-World Inequalities
-------------------------------

**Example:** In order to get a bonus this month, Leon must sell at least 120 newspaper subscriptions. He sold 85 subscriptions in the first three weeks of the month. How many subscriptions must Leon sell in the last week of the month?

**Solution:** The amount of subscriptions Leon needs is “at least” 120. Choose a variable to represent the varying quantity–the number of subscriptions, say $n$. The inequality that represents the situation is $n+85 \ge 120$.

Solve by isolating the variable $n$: $n \ge 35$.

Leon must sell 35 or more subscriptions to receive his bonus.

**Example:** The width of a rectangle is 12 inches. What must the length be if the perimeter is at least 180 inches? (Note: Diagram not drawn to scale.)

![0](media/209.png "Figure 1: **Solution:** The perimeter is the sum of all the sides.")

$$
12+12+x+x \ge 180
$$

Simplify and solve for the variable $x$:

$$
\begin{align*}
12+12+x+x & \ge 180 \rightarrow 24+2x \ge 180\\
2x & \ge 156\\
x & \ge 78
\end{align*}
$$

The length of the rectangle must be 78 inches or larger.

### 6.4 Compound Inequalities

<article>

Inequalities that relate to the same topic can be written as a **compound inequality**. A compound inequality involves the connecting words **“and”** and **“or.”**

The word **and** in mathematics means the **intersection** between the sets.

“What the sets have in common.”

The word **or** in mathematics means the **union** of the sets.

“Combining both sets into one large set.”

Inequalities Involving “And”
----------------------------

Consider, for example, the speed limit situation from the previous lesson. Using interval notation, the solutions to this situation can be written as \[0, 65\]. As an inequality, what is being said it this:

The speed must be at least 0 mph and at most 65 mph.

Using inequalities to represent “at least” and “at most,” the following sentences are written:

$$
s \ge 0 \ \text{and} \ s \le 65
$$

This is an example of a compound inequality. It can be shortened by writing:

$$
0 \le s \le 65
$$

**Example:** Graph the solutions to $-40 \le y < 60$.

**Solution:** Color in a circle above –40 to represent “less than or equal to.” Draw an uncolored circle above 60. The variable is placed between these two values, so the solutions occur between these two numbers.

![0](media/210.png "Figure 1: Inequalities Involving “Or”")
---------------------------

A restaurant offers discounts to children 3 years or younger or to adults over 65. Graph the possible ages eligible to receive the discount.

Begin by writing an inequality to represent each piece. “3 years or younger” means you must be born but must not have celebrated your fourth birthday.

$$
0 \le a < 4
$$

“Adults over 65” implies $a > 65$.

The word **or** between the phrases allows you to graph all the possibilities on one number line.

Solving “And” Compound Inequalities
-----------------------------------

When we solve compound inequalities, we separate the inequalities and solve each of them separately. Then, we combine the solutions at the end.

To solve $3x-5 < x + 9 \le 5x + 13$, begin by separating the inequalities.

$$
\begin{align*}
3x-5 & < x+9 &&&& \ x+9 \le 5x+13\\
2x & < 14 && \text{and} && \quad -4 \le 4x\\
x & < 7 && && \quad -1 \le x \ \text{or } x\ge -1
\end{align*}
$$

The answers are $x<7$ and $x \ge -1$ and can be written as $-1 \le x < 7$. You graph the solutions that satisfy both inequalities.

![0](media/211.png "Figure 2: Solving “Or” Compound Inequalities")
----------------------------------

To solve an “or” compound inequality, separate the individual inequalities. Solve each separately. Then combine the solutions to finish the problem.

To solve $9-2x \le 3$ or $3x+10 \le 6-x$, begin by separating the inequalities.

$$
\begin{align*}
9-2x & \le 3 &&&& 3x+10 \le 6-x\\
-2x & \le -6 && \text{or} && \ \qquad 4x \le -4\\
x & \ge 3 &&&& \qquad \ \ x \le -1
\end{align*}
$$

The answers are $x \ge 3$ or $x \le -1$.

![0](media/212.png "Figure 3: Using a Graphing Calculator to Solve Compound Inequalities")
----------------------------------------------------------

As you have seen in previous lessons, graphing calculators can be used to solve many complex algebraic sentences.

**Example:** Solve $7x-2 < 10x+1 < 9x+5$ using a graphing calculator.

**Solution:** This is a compound inequality $7x-2 < 10x+1$ and $10x+1 < 9x+5.$

To enter a compound inequality:

Press the **\[Y=\]** button.

The inequality symbols are found by pressing **\[TEST\]** **\[2nd\] \[MATH\]**

Enter the inequality as:

![0](media/213.png "Figure 4: $$")
Y_1 = (7x-2 < 10x+1) \ AND \ (10x+1 < 9x+5)
$$

To enter the **\[AND\]** symbol, press **\[TEST\]**. Choose **\[LOGIC\]** on the top row and then select option 1.

![0](media/214.png "Figure 5: The resulting graph looks as shown below.")

The solutions are the values of $x$ for which $y=1$.

In this case, $-1 < x < 4$ .

![0](media/215.png "Figure 6: Solve Real-World Compound Inequalities")
--------------------------------------

![0](media/216.png "Figure 7: **Example:** _The speed of a golf ball in the air is given by the formula $v=-32t+80$, where $t$ is the time since the ball was hit. When is the ball traveling between 20 ft/sec and 30 ft/sec inclusive?_")

**Solution:** We want to find the times when the ball is traveling between 20 ft/sec and 30 ft/sec inclusive. Begin by writing the inequality to represent the unknown values, $20 \le v \le 30$.

Replace the velocity formula $v=-32t+80$, with the minimum and maximum values.

$$
20 \le -32t + 80 \le 30
$$

Separate the compound inequality and solve each separate inequality.

$$
\begin{align*}
20 & \le -32t + 80 &&&& -32t + 80 \le 30\\
32t & \le 60 && \text{and} && \qquad \qquad 50 \le 32t\\
t & \le 1.875 &&&& \qquad \quad \ 1.56 \le t
\end{align*}
$$

$1.56 \le t \le 1.875$. Between 1.56 and 1.875 seconds, the ball is traveling between 20 ft/sec and 30 ft/sec.

Inequalities can also be combined with dimensional analysis.

**Example:** William’s pick-up truck gets between 18 and 22 miles per gallon of gasoline. His gas tank can hold 15 gallons of gasoline. If he drives at an average speed of 40 miles per hour, how much driving time does he get on a full tank of gas?

![0](media/217.png "Figure 8: **Solution:** Use dimensional analysis to get from time per tank to miles per gallon.")

$$
\frac{t \ \cancel{hour}}{1 \ \cancel{tank}} \times \frac{1 \ \cancel{tank}}{15 \ gallons} \times \frac{40 \ miles}{1 \ \cancel{hour}} = \frac{40t}{45} \frac{miles}{gallon}
$$

Since the truck gets between 18 to 22 miles/gallon, you can write a compound inequality.

$$
18 \le \frac{40t}{15} \le 22
$$

Separate the compound inequality and solve each inequality separately.

$$
\begin{align*}
18 & \le \frac{40t}{15} &&&& \frac{40t}{15} \le 22\\
270 & \le 40t && \text{and} && \ 40t \le 330\\
6.75 & \le t &&&& \quad \ t \le 8.25
\end{align*}
$$

William can drive between 6.75 and 8.25 hours on a full tank of gas.

### 6.5 Absolute Value Equations

<article>

In Chapter 2, this textbook introduced the operation **absolute value**. The absolute value of a number is the distance from zero on a number line. The numbers 4 and –4 are each four units away from zero on a number line. So, $|4|=4$ _and_ $|-4|=4$.

Below is a more formal definition of absolute value.

For any real number $x$,

$$
\begin{align*}
|x|& =x \ for \ all \ x \ge 0\\
|x|& =-x (read \ \text{the opposite of} \ x) \  for \ all \ x<0
\end{align*}
$$

The second part of this definition states that the absolute value of a negative number is its opposite (a positive number).

**Example 1:** _Evaluate_ $|-120|$.

**Solution:** The absolute value of a negative number is its inverse, or opposite. Therefore, $|-120|=-(-120)=120$.

Because the absolute value is always positive, it can be used to find the distance between two values on a number line.

The distance between two values $x$ and $y$ on a number line is found by:

$$
distance=|x-y| \ or \ |y-x|
$$

**Example 2:** _Find the distance between –5 and 8._

**Solution:** Use the definition of distance. Let $x=-5$ and $y=8$.

$$
distance=|-5-8|=|-13|
$$

The absolute value of –13 is 13, so –5 and 8 are 13 units apart.

Solving an Absolute Value Equation
----------------------------------

Absolute value situations can also involve unknown variables. For example, suppose the distance from zero is 16. What two points can this represent?

Begin by writing an absolute value sentence to represent this situation.

$$
16=|n|, \ where \ n=the \ missing \ value
$$

Which two numbers are 16 units from zero?

$$
n=16 \ or \ n=-16
$$

Absolute value situations can also involve distance from points other than zero. We treat such cases as compound inequalities, separating the two independent equations and solving separately.

**Example 3:** _Solve for_ $x: |x-4|=5$.

**Solution:** This equation looks like the distance definition

$$
distance=|x-y| \ or \ |y-x|
$$

The distance is 5, and the value of $y$ is 4. We are looking for two values that are five units away from four on a number line.

Visually, we can see the answers are –1 and 9.

Algebraically, we separate the two absolute value equations and solve.

$$
x-4=5 \ and \ x-4=-(5)
$$

By solving each, the solutions become:

$$
x=9 \ and \ x=-1
$$

Solve $|2x-7|=6$.

Begin by separating this into its separate equations.

$$
2x-7=6 \ and \ 2x-7=-6
$$

Solve each equation independently.

$$
\begin{align*}
2x-7& =6 && \qquad 2x-7=-6\\
2x-7+7& =6+7 && \ 2x-7+7=-6+7\\
2x& =13 && \qquad \ \ \quad 2x=1\\
x &=\frac{13}{2} && \qquad \qquad x=\frac{1}{2}
\end{align*}
$$

Example: _A company packs coffee beans in airtight bags. Each bag should weigh 16 ounces but it is hard to fill each bag to the exact weight. After being filled, each bag is weighed and if it is more than 0.25 ounces overweight or underweight, it is emptied and repacked. What are the lightest and heaviest acceptable bags?_

![0](media/225.png "Figure 1: Solution: The varying quantity is the weight of the bag of coffee beans. Choosing a letter to represent this quantity and writing an absolute value equation yields:")

$$
|w-16|=0.25
$$

Separate and solve.

$$
\begin{align*}
w-16& =0.25 && w-16=-0.25\\
w& =16.25 && \qquad \ w=15.75
\end{align*}
$$

The lightest bag acceptable is 15.75 ounces and the heaviest bag accepted is 16.25 ounces.

Graphing an Absolute Value Equation
-----------------------------------

Absolute value equations can be graphed in a way that is similar to graphing linear equations. By making a table of values, you can get a clear picture of what an absolute value equation will look like.

Example: _Graph the solutions to_ $y=|x-1|$.

Solution: Make a table of values and plot the ordered pairs.

| $x$ | $y=\|x-1\|$ |
| --- | --- |
| –2  | $\|-2-1\|=3$ |
| –1  | $\|-1-1\|=2$ |
| 0   | $\|0-1\|=1$ |
| 1   | $\|1-1\|=0$ |
| 2   | $\|2-1\|=1$ |
| 3   | $\|3-1\|=2$ |

Every absolute value graph will make a “V”-shaped figure. It consists of two pieces: one with a negative slope and one with a positive slope. The point of their intersection is called the **vertex**. An absolute value graph is **symmetrical**, meaning it can be folded in half on its **line of symmetry**.

Absolute value equations can always be graphed by making a table of values. However, you can use the vertex and symmetry to help shorten the graphing process.

Step 1: Find the vertex by determining which value of $x$ makes the distance zero.

Step 2: Using this value as the center of the $x-$values, choose several values greater than this value and several values less than this value.

Example: Graph $y=|x+5|$.

Solution: Determine which $x-$value equals a distance of zero.

$$
\begin{align*}
0& =|x+5|\\
x& =-5
\end{align*}
$$

Therefore, (–5, 0) is the vertex of the graph and represents the center of the table of values.

Create the table and plot the ordered pairs.

| $x$ | $y=\|x+5\|$ |
| --- | --- |
| –7  | $\|-7+5\|=2$ |
| –6  | $\|-6+5\|=1$ |
| –5  | $\|-5+5\|=0$ |
| –4  | $\|-4+5\|=1$ |
| –3  | $\|-3+5\|=2$ |

### 6.6 Absolute Value Inequalities

<article>

An absolute value inequality is a combination of two concepts: absolute values and linear inequalities. Therefore, to solve an absolute value inequality, you must use the problem-solving methods of each concept.

* To solve an absolute value equation, use the definition.
    * _If_ $d=|x-a|$, _then_ $x-a=d$ _OR_ $x-a= -d$.
* To solve a linear inequality, use the concepts learned in Lessons 2 and 3 of this chapter.
    * Remember, when dividing by a negative, the inequality symbol must be reversed!

Let’s begin by looking at an example.

$$
|x| \le 3
$$

Since $|x|$ represents the distance from zero, the solutions to this inequality are those numbers whose distance from zero is less than or equal to 3. The following graph shows this solution:

![0](media/226.png "Figure 1: Notice that this is also the graph for the compound inequality $-3 \le x\le 3$.")

Below is a second example.

$$
|x|>2
$$

Since the absolute value of $x$ represents the distance from zero, the solutions to this inequality are those numbers whose distance from zero are more than 2. The following graph shows this solution.

![0](media/227.png "Figure 2: In general, the solutions to absolute value inequalities take two forms:")

1.  If $|x|<a$, then $x<a$ _or_ $x>-a$.
2.  If $|x|>a$, then $x>a$ _or_ $x<-a$.

**Example 1:** Solve $|x+5|>7$.

**Solution:** This equation fits situation 2. Therefore, $x+5>7$ _OR_ $x+5<-7$

Solve each inequality separately.

$$
\begin{align*}
x+5&>7 && x+5<-7 \\
x&>2 && \quad \ \ x<-12
\end{align*}
$$

The solutions are all values greater than two or less than –12.

Example: _The velocity of an object is given by the formula $v=25t-80$, where the time is expressed in seconds and the velocity is expressed in feet per second. Find the times when the velocity is greater than or equal to 60 feet per second._

Solution: We want to find the times when the velocity is greater than or equal to 60 feet per second. Using the formula for velocity $v=25t-80$ and substituting the appropriate values, we obtain the absolute value inequality $|25t-80|\ge 60$

This is an example like case 2. Separate and solve.

$25t-80 \ge 60$ or $25t-80 \le -60$

$25t \ge 140$ or $25t \le 20$

$t \ge 5.6$ or $t \le 0.8$

### 6.7 Linear Inequalities in Two Variables

<article>

When a linear equation is graphed in a coordinate plane, the line splits the plane into two pieces. Each piece is called a **half plane**. The diagram below shows how the half planes are formed when graphing a linear equation.

![0](media/228.png "Figure 1: A linear inequality in two variables can also be graphed. Instead of graphing only the **boundary line** $(y=mx+b)$, you must also include all the other ordered pairs that could be solutions to the inequality. This is called the **solution set** and is shown by shading, or coloring, the half plane that includes the appropriate solutions.")

When graphing inequalities in two variables, you must remember when the value is included ($\le$ _or_ $\ge$) or not included ($<$ _or_ $>$). To represent these inequalities on a coordinate plane, instead of shaded or unshaded circles, we use solid and dashed lines. We can tell which half of the plane the solution is by looking at the inequality sign.

* $>$ The solution is the half plane above the line.
* $\ge$ The solution is the half plane above the line and also all the points on the line.
* $<$ The solution is the half plane below the line.
* $\le$ The solution is the half plane below the line and also all the points on the line.

The solution of $y > mx+b$ is the half plane above the line. The dashed line shows that the points on the line are not part of the solution.

![0](media/229.png "Figure 2: The solution of $y \ge mx+b$ is the half plane above the line and all the points on the line.")

![0](media/230.png "Figure 3: The solution of $y < mx+b$ is the half plane below the line.")

![0](media/231.png "Figure 4: The solution of $y \le mx+b$ is the half plane below the line and all the points on the line.")

![0](media/232.png "Figure 5: **Example 1:** _Graph the inequality_ $y \ge 2x-3$.")

**Solution:** This inequality is in a slope-intercept form. Begin by graphing the line. Then determine the half plane to color.

* The inequality is $\ge$, so the line is solid.
* The inequality states to shade the half plane above the boundary line.

![0](media/233.png "Figure 6: In general, the process used to graph a linear inequality in two variables is:")

**_Step 1:_** Graph the equation using the most appropriate method.

* Slope-intercept form uses the $y-$intercept and slope to find the line.
* Standard form uses the intercepts to graph the line.
* Point-slope uses a point and the slope to graph the line.

**_Step 2:_** If the equal sign is not included, draw a dashed line. Draw a solid line if the equal sign is included.

**_Step 3:_** Shade the half plane above the line if the inequality is “greater than.” Shade the half plane under the line if the inequality is “less than.”

Example: _A pound of coffee blend is made by mixing two types of coffee beans. One type costs $9.00 per pound and another type costs $7.00 per pound. Find all the possible mixtures of weights of the two different coffee beans for which the blend costs $8.50 per pound or less._

Solution: Begin by determining the appropriate letters to represent the varying quantities.

Let $x =$ weight of $9.00 per pound coffee beans in pounds and let $y =$ weight of $7.00 per pound coffee beans in pounds.

Translate the information into an inequality. $9x+7y \le 8.50$.

_Because the inequality is in standard form, it will be easier to graph using its intercepts._

![0](media/234.png "Figure 7: When $x=0, y=1.21$. When $y=0, x=0.944$.")

Graph the inequality. The line will be solid. We shade below the line.

We graphed only the first quadrant of the coordinate plane because neither bag should have a negative weight.

The blue-shaded region tells you all the possibilities of the two bean mixtures that will give a total less than or equal to $8.50.

**Example 2:** _Julian has a job as an appliance salesman. He earns a commission of $60 for each washing machine he sells and $130 for each refrigerator he sells. How many washing machines and refrigerators must Julian sell to make $1,000 or more in commission?_

**Solution:** Determine the appropriate variables for the unknown quantities. Let $x =$ number of washing machines Julian sells and let $y =$ number of refrigerators Julian sells.

Now translate the situation into an inequality. $60x + 130y \ge 1,000$.

Graph the standard form inequality using its intercepts. When $x=0, y=7.692$. When $y=0, x=16.667$. The line will be solid.

We want the ordered pairs that are solutions to Julian making more than $1,000, so we shade the half plane above the boundary line.

![0](media/235.png "Figure 8: Graphing Horizontal and Vertical Linear Inequalities")
----------------------------------------------------

Linear inequalities in one variable can also be graphed in the coordinate plane. They take the form of horizontal and vertical lines, however the process is identical to graphing **oblique**, or slanted, lines.

Example: _Graph the inequality $x>4$ on_: 1) _a number line and_ 2) _the coordinate plane._

Solution: Remember what the solution to $x>4$ looks like on a number line.

![0](media/236.png "Figure 9: The solution to this inequality is the set of all real numbers $x$ that are bigger than four but not including four.")

On a coordinate plane, the line $x=4$ is a vertical line four units to the right of the origin. The inequality **does not equal** four, so the vertical line is dashed. This shows the reader that the ordered pairs on the vertical line $x=4$ are not solutions to the inequality.

The inequality is looking for all $x-$coordinates larger than four. We then color the half plane to the right, symbolizing $x>4$.

![0](media/237.png "Figure 10: Graphing absolute value inequalities can also be done in the coordinate plane. To graph the inequality $|x|\ge 2$, we remember Lesson 6.6 and rewrite the absolute value inequality.")

$x \le -2$ or $x \ge 2$

Then graph each inequality on a coordinate plane.

In other words, the solution is all the coordinate points for which the value of $x$ is smaller than or equal to –2 and greater than or equal to 2. The solution is represented by the plane to the left of the vertical line $x=-2$ and the plane to the right of line $x=2$.

Both vertical lines are solid because points on the line are included in the solution.

### 6.8 Theoretical and Experimental Probability

<article>

So far in this text, you have solved problems dealing with definite situations. In the next several chapters, we will begin to look at a branch of mathematics that deals with **possible situations**. The study of probability involves applying formulas to determine the likelihood of an event occurring.

Almost all companies use some form of probability. Automotive companies want to determine the likelihood of their new vehicle being a big seller. Cereal manufacturers want to know the probability that their cereal will sell more than the competition. Pharmaceutical corporations need to know the likelihood of a new drug harming those who take it. Even politicians want to know the probability of receiving enough votes to win the election.

![0](media/239.png "Figure 1: Probabilities can start with an **experiment**. As you learned in a previous chapter, an experiment is a controlled study. For example, suppose you want to know if the likelihood, or **probability**, of getting tails when flipping a coin is actually $\frac{1}{2}$. By randomly grabbing a penny and making a tally chart of heads and tails, you are performing an experiment.")

The set of all possible outcomes is called the **sample space** of the experiment.

The sample space for tossing a coin is $\left \{heads,\  tails\right \}$.

**Example 1:** _List the sample space for rolling a die._

**Solution:** A die is a six-sided figure with dots representing the numbers one through six. So the sample space is all the possible outcomes (i.e., what numbers could possibly be rolled).

$$
S=\left \{1,2,3,4,5,6,\right \}
$$

Once you have determined the number of items in the sample space, you can compute the probability of a particular **event**.

Any one possible outcome of the experiment is called an **event**.

**Theoretical probability** is a **ratio** expressing the ways to be successful to the total events in an experiment. A shorter way to write this is:

$$
\text{Probability} \ (success) = \frac{number \ of \ ways \ to \ get \ success}{total \ number \ of \ possible \ outcomes}
$$

Probabilities are expressed three ways:

* As a fraction
* As a percent
* As a decimal

Suppose you wanted to know the probability of landing a head or a tail when flipping a coin.

There would be **two** ways to get success and **two** possible outcomes.

$$
P(success)=\frac{2}{2}=1
$$

This is a very important concept of probability.

The sum of individual event probabilities has a sum of **100%**, or **1**.

**Example 2:** _Determine the theoretical probability of rolling a five on a die._

**Solution:** There are six events in the sample space. There is one way to roll a five.

$$
P(rolling \ a \ 5)=\frac{1}{6} \approx 16.67\%
$$

Conducting an Experiment
------------------------

Conducting an experiment for probability purposes is also called _probability simulation_. Suppose you wanted to conduct the coin experiment in the lesson opener. By grabbing a random coin, flipping it, and recording what lands up is a probability simulation. You can also simulate an experiment using a graphing calculator application.

Performing an Experiment Using the TI-84 Graphing Calculator
------------------------------------------------------------

There is an application on the TI calculators called the coin toss. Among others (including the dice roll, spinners, and picking random numbers), the coin toss is an excellent application for when you what to find the probabilities for a coin tossed more than four times or more than one coin being tossed multiple times.

![0](media/240.png "Figure 2: Let’s say you want to see one coin being tossed one time. Here is what the calculator will show and the key strokes to get to this toss.")

![0](media/241.png "Figure 3: Let’s say you want to see one coin being tossed ten times. Here is what the calculator will show and the key strokes to get to this sequence. Try it on your own.")

![0](media/242.png "Figure 4: We can actually see how many heads and tails occurred in the tossing of the 10 coins. If you click on the right arrow $(>)$ the frequency label will show you how many of the tosses came up heads.")

![0](media/243.png "Figure 5: Using this information, you can determine the **experimental probability** of tossing a coin and seeing a tail on its landing.")

The **experimental probability** is the ratio of the proposed outcome to the number of experiment trials.

$$
P(success)= \frac{number \ of \ times \ the \ event \ occurred}{total \ number \ of \ trials \ of \ experiment}
$$

**Example 3:** _Compare the theoretical probability of flipping a tail to the experimental probability of flipping a tail on a coin._

**Solution:** There are two events in the sample space. There is one way to flip a tail.

$$
P(flipping \ a \ tail)=\frac{1}{2}
$$

The coin toss simulation the calculator performed stated there were six tails out of ten tosses.

$$
P(flipping \ a \ tail)=\frac{6}{10}
$$

The experimental probability (60%) in this case is greater than the theoretical probability (50%).

Finding Odds For and Against
----------------------------

Odds are similar to probability with the exception of the ratio's denominator.

The **odds in favor** of an event is the ratio of the number of successful events to the number of non-successful events.

$$
\text{Odds} \ (success) = \frac{number \ of \ ways \ to \ get \ success}{number \ of \ ways \ to \ not \ get \ success}
$$

For example, suppose we were interested in the odds of rolling a 5 on a die.

![0](media/244.png "Figure 6: What if we were interested in determining the odds against rolling a 5 on a die. There are five outcomes other than a “5” and one outcome of a “5.”")

$$
Odds \ against \ rolling \ a \ 5=  \frac{5}{1}
$$

**Example 4:** _Find the odds against rolling a number larger than 2 on a standard die._

**Solution:** There are four outcomes on a standard die larger than $2: \left \{3,4,5,6\right \}$.

$$
Odds \ against \ rolling>2= \frac{2}{4}
$$

Notice the “odds against” ratio is the **reciprocal** of the “odds in favor” ratio.

## 7.0 Systems of Equations and Inequalities; Counting Methods

<article>

James is trying to expand his pastry business to include cupcakes and personal cakes. He has a limited amount of manpower to decorate the new items and a limited amount of material to make the new cakes. In this chapter, you will learn how to solve this type of situation.

![0](media/245.png "Figure 1: Every equation and inequality you have studied thus far is an example of a **system**. A system is a set of equations or inequalities with the same variables. This chapter focuses on the methods used to solve a system such as graphing, substitution and elimination.

### 7.1 Linear Systems by Graphing

<article>

In a previous chapter, you learned that the intersection of two sets is joined by the word “and.” This word also joins two or more equations or inequalities. A set of algebraic sentences joined by the word “and” is called a **system.**

The **solution(s)** to a system is the set of ordered pairs that is in common to each algebraic sentence.

**Example 1:** _Determine which of the points_ (1, 3), (0, 2), _or_ (2, 7) _is a solution to the following system of equations. 

$$
\begin{cases}
y = 4x - 1 \\
y = 2x + 3 \end{cases}
$$

_

**Solution:** A solution to a system is an ordered pair that is in common to all the algebraic sentences. To determine if a particular ordered pair is a solution, substitute the coordinates for the variables $x$ and $y$ in each sentence and check.

Check (1, 3) : 

$$
\begin{cases}
3 = 4(1)-1; \ 3=3. \ Yes, \ this \ ordered \ pairs \ checks. \\
3 = 2(1)+3; \ 3=5. \ No, \ this \ ordered \ pair \ does \ not \ check. \end{cases}
$$

Check (0, 2) : 

$$
\begin{cases}
2=4(0)-1; \ 2=-1. \ No, \ this \ ordered \ pair \ does \ not \ check. \\
2=2(0)+3; \ 2=3. \ No, \ this \ ordered \ pair \ does \ not \ check. \end{cases}
$$

Check (2, 7) : 

$$
\begin{cases}
7=4(2)-1; \ 7=7. \ Yes, \ this \ ordered \ pairs \ checks. \\
7=2(2)+3; \ 7=7. \ Yes, \ this \ ordered \ pairs \ checks. \end{cases}
$$

Because the coordinate (2, 7) works in both equations simultaneously, it is a solution to the system.

To determine the coordinate that is in common to each sentence in the system, each equation can be graphed. The point at which the lines **intersect** represents the solution to the system. The solution can be written two ways:

* As an ordered pair, such as (2, 7)
* By writing the value of each variable, such as $x=2, \ y=7$

Example: _Find the solution to the system_ 

$$
\begin{cases}
y=3x-5\\
y=-2x+5 \end {cases}
$$

.

Solution: By graphing each equation and finding the point of intersection, you find the solution to the system.

Each equation is written in slope-intercept form and can be graphed using the methods learned in Chapter 4.

The lines appear to intersect at the ordered pair (2, 1). Is this the solution to the system?

![0](media/246.png "Figure 1: $$")
\begin{cases}
1=3(2)-5; \quad 1=1\\
1=-2(2)+5; \ 1=1 \end {cases}
$$

The coordinate checks in both sentences. Therefore, (2, 1) is a solution to the system 

$$
\begin{cases}
y=3x-5\\
y=-2x+5 \end{cases}
$$

.

**Example 2:** _Solve the system_ 

$$
\begin{cases}
x+y=2\\
\qquad y=3 \end{cases}
$$

.

**Solution:** The first equation is written in standard form. Using its intercepts will be the easiest way to graph this line.

The second equation is a horizontal line three units up from the origin.

![0](media/247.png "Figure 2: The lines appear to intersect at (–1, 3).")

$$
\begin{cases}
-1+3=2; \ 2=2\\
\qquad 3=3 \end{cases}
$$

The coordinate is in common to each sentence and is a solution to the system.

The greatest strength of the graphing method is that it offers a very visual representation of a system of equations and its solution. You can see, however, that determining a solution from a graph would require very careful graphing of the lines and is really practical only when you are certain that the solution gives integer values for $x$ and $y$. In most cases, this method can offer only approximate solutions to systems of equations. For exact solutions, other methods are necessary.

Solving Systems Using a Graphing Calculator
-------------------------------------------

A graphing calculator can be used to find or check solutions to a system of equations. To solve a system graphically, you must graph the two lines on the same coordinate axes and find the point of intersection. You can use a graphing calculator to graph the lines as an alternative to graphing the equations by hand.

Using the system from the above example, 

$$
\begin{cases}
y=3x-5\\
y=-2x+5 \end{cases}
$$

, we will use the graphing calculator to find the approximate solutions to the system.

![0](media/248.png "Figure 3: Begin by entering the equations into the $Y=$ menu of the calculator.")

You already know the solution to the system is (2, 1). The window needs to be adjusted so an accurate picture is seen. Change your window to the **default window**.

![0](media/249.png "Figure 4: See the graphs by pressing the **GRAPH** button.")

![0](media/250.png "Figure 5: The solution to a system is the intersection of the equations. To find the intersection using a graphing calculator, locate the **Calculate** menu by pressing $2^{nd}$ and **TRACE**. Choose option #5 – **INTERSECTION**.")

![0](media/251.png "Figure 6: The calculator will ask you **“First Curve?”** Hit **ENTER**. The calculator will automatically jump to the other curve and ask you **“Second Curve?”** Hit **ENTER**. The calculator will ask, **“Guess?”** Hit **ENTER**. The intersection will appear at the bottom of the screen.")

![0](media/252.png "Figure 7: Example: _Peter and Nadia like to race each other. Peter can run at a speed of 5 feet per second and Nadia can run at a speed of 6 feet per second. To be a good sport, Nadia likes to give Peter a head start of 20 feet. How long does Nadia take to catch up with Peter? At what distance from the start does Nadia catch up with Peter?_")

![0](media/253.png "Figure 8: Solution: Begin by translating each runner’s situation into an algebraic sentence using $distance=rate \times time$.")

Peter: $d=5t+20$

Nadia: $d=6t$

The question asks when Nadia catches Peter. The solution is the point of intersection of the two lines. Graph each equation and find the intersection.

![0](media/254.png "Figure 9: ![0](media/255.png)")

\[Figure 10\]

The two lines cross at the coordinate $t=20, \ d=120$. This means after 20 seconds Nadia will catch Peter. At this time, they will be at a distance of 120 feet. Any time after 20 seconds Nadia will be farther from the starting line than Peter.

### 7.2 Solving Systems by Substitution

<article>

While the graphical approach to solving systems is helpful, it may not always provide exact answers. Therefore, we will learn a second method to solving systems. This method uses the **Substitution Property of Equality**.

**Substitution Property of Equality:** If $y=$ _an algebraic expression_, then the algebraic expression can be substituted for any $y$ in an equation or an inequality.

Consider the racing example from the previous lesson.

_Peter and Nadia like to race each other. Peter can run at a speed of 5 feet per second and Nadia can run at a speed of 6 feet per second. To be a good sport, Nadia likes to give Peter a head start of 20 feet. How long does Nadia take to catch up with Peter? At what distance from the start does Nadia catch up with Peter?_

![0](media/256.png "Figure 1: The two racers' information was translated into two equations.")

Peter: $d=5t+20$

Nadia: $d=6t$

We want to know when the two racers will be the same distance from the start. This means we can set the two equations equal to each other.

$$
5t+20=6t
$$

Now solve for $t$.

$$
\begin{align*}
5t-5t+20& =6t-5t\\
20& = 1t
\end{align*}
$$

After 20 seconds, Nadia will catch Peter.

Now we need to determine how far from the distance the two runners are. You already know $20=t$, so we will substitute to determine the distance. Using _either equation_, substitute the known value for $t$ and find $d$.

$$
d=5(20)+20 \rightarrow 120
$$

When Nadia catches Peter, the runners are 120 feet from the starting line.

The **Substitution Method** is useful when one equation of the system is of the form $y=$ _algebraic expression_ or $x=$ _algebraic expression_.

**Example 1:** _Solve the system_ 

$$
\begin{cases}
x+y=2\\
\qquad y=3 \end{cases}
$$

**Solution:** The second equation is solved for the variable $x$. Therefore, we can substitute the value “3” for any $y$ in the system.

$$
x+y=2 \rightarrow x+3=2
$$

Now solve the equation for $x:$ 

$$
\begin{align*}
x+3-3& =2-3\\
x & = -1
\end{align*}
$$

The $x-$coordinate of the intersection of these two equations is –1. Now we must find the $y-$coordinate using substitution.

$$
\begin{align*}
x+y & = 2 \rightarrow (-1)+y=2\\
-1+1+y& = 2+1\\
y & = 3
\end{align*}
$$

As seen in the previous lesson, the solution to the system is (–1, 3).

Example: _Find the solution to the system_ 

$$
\begin{cases}
y=3x-5\\
y=-2x+5 \end{cases}
$$

 _using substitution_.

Solution: Each equation is equal to the variable $y$, therefore the two algebraic expressions must equal each other.

$$
3x-5=-2x+5
$$

Solve for $x$.

$$
\begin{align*}
3x-5+5&=-2x+5+5\\
3x+2x&=-2x+2x+10\\
5x&=10\\
x&=2
\end{align*}
$$

The $x-$coordinate of the intersection of the two lines is 2. Now you must find the $y-$coordinate using **_either of the two equations_**.

$$
y=-2(2)+5=1
$$

The solution to the system is $x=2, \ y=1$ or (2, 1).

Solving Real-World Systems by Substitution
------------------------------------------

Example: _Anne is trying to choose between two phone plans. Vendaphone’s plan costs $20 per month, with calls costing an additional 25 cents per minute. Sellnet’s plan charges $40 per month, but calls cost only 8 cents per minute. Which should she choose?_

Solution: Anne’s choice will depend upon how many minutes of calls she expects to use each month. We start by writing two equations for the cost in dollars in terms of the minutes used. Since the number of minutes is the independent variable, it will be our $x$. Cost is dependent on minutes. The _cost per month_ is the _dependent_ variable and will be assigned $y$.

$$
\begin{align*}
& \text{For Vendafone} && y =0.25x+20\\
& \text{For Sellnet} && y = 0.08x+40
\end{align*}
$$

![0](media/257.png "Figure 2: By graphing two equations, we can see that at some point the two plans will charge the same amount, represented by the intersection of the two lines. Before this point, Sellnet’s plan is more expensive. After the intersection, Sellnet’s plan is cheaper.")

Use substitution to find the point that the two plans are the same. Each algebraic expression is equal to $y$, so they must equal each other.

$$
\begin{align*}
0.25x+20 & =0.08x+40 && \text{Subtract 20 from both sides.}\\
0.25x & = 0.08x+20 && \text{Subtract} \ 0.08x \ \text{from both sides.}\\
0.17x & = 20 && \text{Divide both sides by 0.17.}\\
x & = 117.65 \ \text{minutes} && \text{Rounded to two decimal places.}
\end{align*}
$$

We can now use our sketch, plus this information, to provide an answer. If Anne will use 117 minutes or fewer every month, she should choose Vendafone. If she plans on using 118 or more minutes, she should choose Sellnet.

Mixture Problems
----------------

Systems of equations arise in chemistry when mixing chemicals in solutions and can even be seen in things like mixing nuts and raisins or examining the change in your pocket!

By rearranging one sentence in an equation into $y=$ _algebraic expression_ or $x=$ _algebraic expression_, you can use the Substitution Method to solve the system.

![0](media/258.png "Figure 3: Example: _Nadia empties her purse and finds that it contains only nickels and dimes. If she has a total of 7 coins and they have a combined value of 55 cents, how many of each coin does she have?_")

Solution: Begin by choosing appropriate variables for the unknown quantities. Let $n=$ _the number of nickels_ and $d=$ _the number of dimes_.

There are seven coins in Nadia’s purse: $n+d=7$.

The total is 55 cents: $0.05n+0.10d=0.55$.

The system is: 

$$
\begin{cases}
\qquad \quad \ \ n+d=7\\
0.05n+0.10d=0.55 \end{cases}
$$

.

We can quickly rearrange the first equation to isolate $d$, the number of dimes: $d=7-n$.

Using the Substitution Property, every $d$ can be replaced with the expression $7-n$.

$$
\begin{align*}
0.05n+0.10(7-n)&=0.55\\
\text{Now solve for} \ n: \qquad 0.05n+0.70-0.10n&=0.55 \qquad \text{Distributive Property}\\
-0.05n+0.70&=0.55 \qquad \text{Add like terms.}\\
-0.05n&=-0.15 \quad \ \text{Subtract} \ 0.70.\\
n& =3 \qquad \quad \ \text{Divide by} \ -0.05.
\end{align*}
$$

Nadia has 3 nickels. There are seven coins in the purse; three are nickels so four must be dimes.

Check to make sure this combination is 55 cents: $0.05(3)+ 0.10(4)= 0.15+0.40=0.55$.

Chemical Mixtures
-----------------

Example: _A chemist has two containers, Mixture $A$ and Mixture $B$. Mixture $A$ has a 60% copper sulfate concentration. Mixture $B$ has a 5% copper sulfate concentration. The chemist needs to have a mixture equaling 500 mL with a 15% concentration. How much of each mixture does the chemist need?_

![0](media/259.png "Figure 4: Solution: Although not explicitly stated, there are two equations involved in this situation.")

* Begin by stating the variables. Let $A = mixture \ A \ and \ B = mixture \ B$.
* The total mixture needs to have 500 mL of liquid.

Equation 1 (how much total liquid): $A+B=500$.

* The total amount of copper sulfate needs to be 15% of the total amount of solution (500 mL). $0.15 \cdot 500=75 \ ounces$

Equation 2 (how much copper sulfate the chemist needs): $0.60A+0.05B=75$

$$
\begin{cases}
A+B=500\\
0.60A+0.05B=75 \end{cases}
$$

By rewriting equation 1, the Substitution Property can be used: $A=500-B$.

Substitute the expression $500-B$ for the variable $A$ in the second equation.

$$
0.60(500-B)+0.05B=75
$$

Solve for $B$.

$$
\begin{align*}
300-0.60B+0.05B& =75 && \text{Distributive Property}\\
300-0.55B&=75 && \text{Add like terms.}\\
-0.55B&=-225 && \text{Subtract} \ 300.\\
B & \approx 409 \ mL
\end{align*}
$$

The chemist needs approximately 409 mL of mixture $B$. To find the amount of mixture $A$, use the first equation: $A+409=500$

$$
A=91 \ mL
$$

The chemist needs 91 milliliters of mixture $A$ and 409 milliliters of mixture $B$ to get a 500 mL solution with a 15% copper sulfate concentration.

### 7.3 Solving Linear Systems by Addition or Subtraction

<article>

As you noticed in the previous lesson, solving a system algebraically will give you the most accurate answer and in some cases, it is easier than graphing. However, you also noticed that it took some work in several cases to rewrite one equation **before** you could use the Substitution Property. There is another method used to solve systems algebraically: the **elimination method**.

The purpose of the **elimination method** to solve a system is to cancel, or eliminate, a variable by either adding or subtracting the two equations. This method works well if both equations are in standard form.

**Example 1:** _If one apple plus one banana costs $1.25 and one apple plus two bananas costs $2.00, how much does it cost for one banana? One apple?_

**Solution:** Begin by defining the variables of the situation. Let $a=$ _the number of apples_ and $b=$ _the number of bananas_. By translating each purchase into an equation, you get the following system:

$$
\begin{cases}
a+b=1.25\\
a+2b=2.00 \end{cases}
$$

.

You could rewrite the first equation and use the Substitution Property here, but because both equations are in standard form, you can also use the elimination method.

Notice that each equation has the value $1a$. If you were to subtract these equations, what would happen?

$$
\begin{align*}
& \qquad a + b \ =1.25\\
&\underline{\;\;\;- (a+2b=2.00)\;\;\;}\\
& \qquad \quad -b =-0.75\\
& \qquad \qquad \ b =0.75
\end{align*}
$$

Therefore, one banana costs $0.75, or 75 cents. By subtracting the two equations, we were able to **eliminate** a variable and solve for the one remaining.

How much is one apple? Use the first equation and the Substitution Property.

$$
\begin{align*}
a+0.75&=1.25\\
a&=0.50 \rightarrow one \ apple \ costs \ 50 \ cents
\end{align*}
$$

Example: _Solve the system_ 

$$
\begin{cases}
3x+2y=11\\
5x-2y=13\end{cases}
$$

.

Solution: These equations would take much more work to rewrite in slope-intercept form to graph or to use the Substitution Property. This tells us to try to eliminate a variable. The coefficients of the $x-$variables have nothing in common, so adding will not cancel the $x-$variable.

Looking at the $y-$variable, you can see the coefficients are 2 and –2. By adding these together, you get zero. Add these two equations and see what happens.

&nbsp;

$$
\begin{align*}
& \qquad \ 3x+2y =11\\
&\underline{\;\; + \ (5x-2y) =13 \;\;}\\
& \qquad \ 8x+0y =24
\end{align*}
$$

The resulting equation is $8x=24$. Solving for $x$, you get $x=3$. To find the $y-$coordinate, choose _either equation_, and substitute the number 3 for the variable $x$.

$$
\begin{align*}
3(3)+2y&=11\\
9+2y&=11\\
2y&=2\\
y&=1
\end{align*}
$$

The point of intersection of these two equations is (3, 1).

![0](media/263.png "Figure 1: Example: _Andrew is paddling his canoe down a fast-moving river. Paddling downstream he travels at 7 miles per hour, relative to the river bank. Paddling upstream, he moves slower, traveling at 1.5 miles per hour. If he paddles equally hard in both directions, calculate, in miles per hour, the speed of the river and the speed Andrew would travel in calm water._")

Solution: We have two unknowns to solve for, so we will call the speed that Andrew paddles at $x$, and the speed of the river $y$. When traveling downstream, Andrew's speed is boosted by the river current, so his total speed is the canoe speed plus the speed of the river $(x+y)$. Upstream, his speed is hindered by the speed of the river. His speed upstream is $(x-y)$.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Downstream Equation} && x+y&=7\\
\text{Upstream Equation} && x-y&=1.5
\end{align*}
$$

Notice $y$ and $-y$ are additive inverses. If you add them together, their sum equals zero. Therefore, by adding the two equations together, the variable $y$ will cancel, leaving you to solve for the remaining variable, $x$.

&nbsp;

$$
\begin{align*}
& \qquad \ x+y=7\\
&\underline{\;\; + \ (x-y)=1.5 \;\;}\\
& \quad \ 2x+0y=8.5\\
& \qquad \quad \ \ 2x=8.5
\end{align*}
$$

Therefore, $x=4.25$; Andrew is paddling $4.25 \ miles/hour$. To find the speed of the river, substitute your known value into either equation and solve.

$$
\begin{align*}
4.25-y&=1.5\\
-y&=-2.75\\
y&=2.75
\end{align*}
$$

The stream’s current is moving at a rate of $2.75 \ miles/hour$.

### 7.4 Solving Linear Systems by Multiplication

<article>

This chapter has provided three methods to solve systems: graphing, substitution, and elimination through addition and subtraction. As stated in each lesson, these methods have strengths and weaknesses. Below is a summary.

**Graphing**

$\checkmark$ A good technique to visualize the equations and when both equations are in slope-intercept form.

* Solving a system by graphing is often imprecise and will not provide exact solutions.

**Substitution**

$\checkmark$ Works particularly well when one equation is in standard form and the second equation is in slope-intercept form.

$\checkmark$ Gives exact answers.

* Can be difficult to use substitution when both equations are in standard form.

**Elimination by Addition or Subtraction**

$\checkmark$ Works well when both equations are in standard form **and** the coefficients of one variable are additive inverses.

$\checkmark$ Answers will be exact.

* Can be difficult to use if one equation is in standard form and the other is in slope-intercept form.
* Addition or subtraction does not work if the coefficients of one variable are not additive inverses.

Although elimination by only addition and subtraction does not work without additive inverses, you can use the Multiplication Property of Equality and the Distributive Property to create additive inverses.

**Multiplication Property and Distributive Property:**

_If_ $ax+by=c$, _then_ $m(ax+by)=m(c)$ and $m(ax+by)=m(c)\rightarrow(am)x+(bm)y=mc$

While this definition box may seem complicated, it really states you can multiply the entire equation by a particular value and then use the Distributive Property to simplify. The value you are multiplying is called a **scalar**.

Example: _Solve the system_ 

$$
\begin{cases}
7x+4y=12\\
5x-2y=11 \end{cases}
$$

.

Solution: Neither variable has additive inverse coefficients. Therefore, simply adding or subtracting the two equations will not cancel either variable. However, there is a relationship between the coefficients of the $y-$variable.

$$
4 \ is \ the \ additive \ inverse \ of-2 \times (2)
$$

.

By multiplying the second equation by the scalar 2, you will create additive inverses of $y$. You can then add the equations.

$$
\begin{align*}
\begin{cases}
7x+4y=12\\
2(5x-2y=11) \end{cases} & \rightarrow \quad \begin{cases}
7x+4y=12\\
10x-4y=22 \end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Add the two equations.} && 17x&=34\\
\text{Divide by} \ 17. && x&=2
\end{align*}
$$

To find the $y-$value, use the Substitution Property in either equation.

$$
\begin{align*}
7(2)+4y&=12\\
14+4y&=12\\
4y&=-2\\
y&=-\frac{1}{2}
\end{align*}
$$

The solution to this system is $\left ( 2, -\frac{1}{2} \right )$.

Example: _Andrew and Anne both use the I-Haul truck rental company to move their belongings from home to the dorm rooms on the University of Chicago campus. I-Haul has a charge per day and an additional charge per mile. Andrew travels from San Diego, California, a distance of 2,060 miles in five days. Anne travels 880 miles from Norfolk, Virginia, and it takes her three days. If Anne pays $840 and Andrew pays $1,845.00, what does I-Haul charge:_

_a) per day?_

_b) per mile traveled?_

Solution: Begin by writing a system of linear equations: one to represent Anne and the second to represent Andrew. Let $x=$ _amount charged per day_ and $y=$ _amount charged per mile_.

$$
\begin{cases}
3x+880y=840\\
5x+2060y=1845 \end{cases}
$$

There are no relationships seen between the coefficients of the variables. Instead of multiplying one equation by a scalar, we must multiply both equations by the **least common multiple**.

The **least common multiple** is the smallest value that is divisible by two or more quantities **without a remainder**.

Suppose we wanted to eliminate the variable $x$ because the numbers are smaller to work with. The coefficients of $x$ must be additive inverses of the **least common multiple**.

$$
LCM \ of \ 3 \ and \ 5=15
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
\begin{cases}
-5(3x+880y=840)\\
3(5x+2060y=1845) \end{cases} & \rightarrow \quad \begin{cases}
-15x-4400y=-4200\\
15x+6180y=5535 \end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{Adding the two equations yields:} && 1780y =1335\\
&\text{Divide by} 1780 && \qquad \quad \ y=0.75
\end{align*}
$$

The company charges $0.75 per mile.

To find the amount charged per day, use the Substitution Property and either equation.

$$
\begin{align*}
5x+2060(0.75)&=1845\\
5x+1545&=1845\\
5x+1545-1545&=1845-1545\\
5x&=300\\
x&=60
\end{align*}
$$

I-Haul charges $60.00 per day and $0.75 per mile.

### 7.5 Special Types of Linear Systems

<article>

Solutions to a system can have several forms:

* One intersection
* Two or more solutions
* No solutions
* An infinite amount of solutions

Inconsistent Systems
--------------------

This lesson will focus on the last two situations: systems with no solutions or systems with an infinite amount of solutions.

A system with parallel lines will have **no solutions**.

Remember from chapter 5 that parallel lines have the same slope. When graphed, the lines will have the same steepness with different $y-$intercepts. Therefore, parallel lines will never intersect, thus they have no solution.

![0](media/264.png "Figure 1: Algebraically, a system with no solutions looks like this when solved.")

$$
\begin{cases}
4y=5-3x\\
6x+8y=7 \end{cases}
$$

The first equation in this system is “almost” solved for $y$. Substitution would be appropriate to solve this system.

$$
\begin{cases}
4y=5-3x\\
6x+8y=7 \end{cases} \rightarrow \quad \begin{cases}
y=\frac{5}{4}-\frac{3}{4} x\\
6x+8y=7 \end{cases}
$$

Using the Substitution Property, replace the $y-$variable in the second equation with its algebraic expression in equation #1.

$$
\begin{align*}
&&6x+8\left ( \frac{5}{4}-\frac{3}{4} x \right )&=7\\
\text{Apply the Distributive Property.} && 6x+10-6x&=7\\
\text{Add like terms.} && 10&=7
\end{align*}
$$

You have solved the equation correctly, yet the answer does not make sense.

When solving a system of parallel lines, the final equation will be untrue.

Because $10 \neq 7$ and you have done your math correctly, you can say this system has “no solutions.”

A system with no solutions is called an **inconsistent system**.

Consistent Systems
------------------

**Consistent systems,** on the contrary, have at least one solution. This means there is at least one intersection of the lines. There are three cases for consistent systems:

* One intersection, as you have practiced the majority of this chapter
* Two or more intersections, as you will see when a quadratic equation intersects a linear equation
* Infinitely many intersections, as with **coincident lines**

![0](media/265.png "Figure 2: ![0](media/266.png)")

\[Figure 3\]

**Coincident lines** are lines with the same slope and $y-$intercept. The lines completely overlap.

When solving a consistent system involving coincident lines, the solution has the following result.

$$
\begin{cases}
x+y=3\\
3x+3y=9 \end{cases}
$$

Multiply the first equation by –3: 

$$
\begin{cases}
-3(x+y=3)\\
3x+3y=9\end{cases} \rightarrow \quad  \begin{cases}
-3x-3y=-9\\
3x+3y=9 \end{cases}
$$

Add the equations together.

$$
0=0
$$

There are no variables left and you KNOW you did the math correctly. However, this is a true statement.

When solving a system of coincident lines, the resulting equation will be without variables and the statement will be **true**. You can conclude the system has an **infinite number of solutions**. This is called a **consistent-dependent system**.

**Example 1:** _Identify the system as consistent, inconsistent, or consistent-dependent._

$$
\begin{align*}
3x-2y&=4\\
9x-6y&=1
\end{align*}
$$

**Solution:** Because both equations are in standard form, elimination is the best method to solve this system.

Multiply the first equation by 3.

$$
\begin{align*}
3(3x-2y=4)&&9x-6y=12\\
& \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \Rightarrow & \qquad\\
9x-6y=1&&9x-6y=1
\end{align*}
$$

Subtract the two equations.

&nbsp; 

$$
\begin{align*}
& \ \ 9x-6y=12\\
& \underline{\;\; 9x-6y=1 \;\;}\\
& \qquad \quad \ 0=11 \quad \text{This Statement is not true.}
\end{align*}
$$

This is an untrue statement; therefore, you can conclude:

1.  These lines are parallel.
2.  The system has no solution.
3.  The system is inconsistent.

**Example 2**: _Two movie rental stores are in competition. Movie House charges an annual membership of $30 and charges $3 per movie rental. Flicks for Cheap charges an annual membership of $15 and charges $3 per movie rental. After how many movie rentals would Movie House become the better option?_

Solution: It should already be clear to see that Movie House will never become the better option, since its membership is more expensive and it charges the same amount per move as Flicks for Cheap.

The lines that describe each option have different $y-$intercepts, namely 30 for Movie House and 15 for Flicks for Cheap. They have the same slope, three dollars per movie. This means that the lines are parallel and the system is inconsistent.

Let’s see how this works algebraically.

Define the variables: Let $x=$ _number of movies rented_ and $y=$ _total rental cost_

$$
\begin{cases}
y=30+3x\\
y=15+3x \end{cases}
$$

Because both equations are in slope-intercept form, solve this system by substituting the second equation into the first equation.

$$
15+3x=30+3x\Rightarrow15=30
$$

This statement is always false. Therefore, the system is **inconsistent** with no solutions.

### 7.6 Systems of Linear Inequalities

<article>

The chapter moves on to the concept of systems of linear inequalities. In the last chapter, you learned how to graph a linear inequality in two variables.

**_Step 1:_** Graph the equation using the most appropriate method.

* Slope-intercept form uses the $y-$intercept and slope to find the line.
* Standard form uses the intercepts to graph the line.
* Point-slope uses a point and the slope to graph the line.

**_Step 2:_** If the equal sign is not included draw a dashed line. Draw a solid line if the equal sign is included.

**_Step 3:_** Shade the half plane above the line if the inequality is “greater than.” Shade the half plane under the line if the inequality is “less than.”

In this section, we will learn how to graph two or more linear inequalities on the same coordinate plane. The inequalities are graphed separately on the same graph and **the solution for the system of inequalities** is the common shaded region between all the inequalities in the system.

The common shaded region of the system of inequalities is called the **feasible region**.

Example: _Solve the system of inequalities_ 

$$
\begin{cases}
2x+3y\le18\\
x-4y\le12 \end{cases}
$$

.

Solution: The first equation is written in standard form and can be graphed using its intercepts. The line is solid because the equal sign is included in the inequality. Since the inequality is less than or equal to, shade the half plane below the line.

![0](media/268.png "Figure 1: The second equation is a little tricky. Rewrite this in slope-intercept form to graph.")

$$
\begin{align*}
&\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \Rightarrow \\
&-4y \le -x+12  && y \ge \frac{x}{4}-3
\end{align*}
$$

The division by –4 causes the inequality to reverse. The line is solid again because the equal sign is included in the inequality. Shade the half plane above the boundary line because $y$ is **greater** than or equal.

![0](media/269.png "Figure 2: When we combine the graphs, we see that the blue and red shaded regions overlap. This overlap is where both inequalities work. Thus the purple region denotes the solution of the system, the **feasible region**.")

![0](media/270.png "Figure 3: The kind of solution displayed in this example is called **unbounded**, because it continues forever in at least one direction (in this case, forever upward and to the left).")

**Bounded** regions occur when more than two inequalities are graphed on the same coordinate plane, as in the next example.

Example: _Find the solution set to the following system._

$$
\begin{align*}
y & > 3x-4\\
y & < -\frac{9}{4}x+2\\
x & \ge 0\\
y & \ge 0
\end{align*}
$$

Solution: Graph each line and shade appropriately.

![0](media/271.png "Figure 4: $$")
y > 3x-4
$$

![0](media/272.png "Figure 5: $$")
y < - \frac{9}{4}x+2
$$

Finally we graph and $x \ge 0$ and $y \ge 0$, and the intersecting region is shown in the following figure.

![0](media/273.png "Figure 6: Writing Systems of Linear Inequalities")
--------------------------------------

In some cases, you are given the feasible region and asked to write the system of inequalities. To do this, you work in reverse order of graphing.

* Write the equation for the boundary line.
* Determine whether the sign should include “or equal to.”
* Determine which half plane is shaded.
* Repeat for each boundary line in the feasible region.

Example: _Write the system of inequalities shown below_.

![0](media/274.png "Figure 7: There are two boundary lines, so there are two inequalities. Write each one in slope-intercept form.")

$$
\begin{align*}
y & \le \frac{1}{4} x + 7\\
y & \ge -\frac{5}{2} x - 5
\end{align*}
$$

Linear Programming – Real-World Systems of Linear Inequalities
--------------------------------------------------------------

Entire careers are devoted to using systems of inequalities to ensure a company is making the most profit by producing the right combination of items or is spending the least amount of money to make certain items. **Linear programming** is the mathematical process of analyzing a system of inequalities to make the best decisions given the constraints of the situation.

**Constraints** are the particular restrictions of a situation due to time, money, or materials.

The goal is to locate the feasible region of the system and use it to answer a profitability, or **optimization**, question.

**Theorem:** The maximum or minimum values of an optimization equation occur at the vertices of the feasible region – at the points where the boundary lines intersect.

This theorem provides an important piece of information. While the individual colors of the inequalities will overlap, providing an infinite number of possible combinations, only the vertices will provide the maximum (or minimum) solutions to the optimization equation.

Let’s go back to the situation presented in the chapter opener.

James is trying to expand his pastry business to include cupcakes and personal cakes. He has 40 hours available to decorate the new items and can use no more than 22 pounds of cake mix. Each personal cake requires 2 pounds of cake mix and 2 hours to decorate. Each cupcake order requires one pound of cake mix and 4 hours to decorate. If he can sell each personal cake for $14.99 and each cupcake order for $16.99, how many personal cakes and cupcake orders should James make to make the most revenue?

There are four inequalities in this situation. First, state the variables. Let $p=$ _the number of personal cakes_ and $c=$ _the number of cupcake orders_.

Translate this into a system of inequalities.

$2p+1c \le 22$ – This is the amount of available cake mix.

$2p+4c \le 40$ – This is the available time to decorate.

$p \ge 0$ – You cannot make negative personal cakes.

$c \ge 0$ – You cannot make negative cupcake orders.

Now graph each inequality and determine the feasible region.

![0](media/275.png "Figure 8: The feasible region has four vertices {(0, 0),(0, 10),(11, 0),(8, 6)}. According to our theorem, the optimization answer will **only occur** at one of these vertices.")

Write the optimization equation: How much of each type of order should James make to bring in the most revenue?

$$
14.99p+16.99c=maximum \ revenue
$$

Substitute each ordered pair to determine which makes the most money

$$
\begin{align*}
(0,0) & \rightarrow \$0.00\\
(0,10) & \rightarrow 14.99(0)+16.99(10)=\$169.90\\
(11,0) &\rightarrow 14.99(11)+16.99(0)=\$164.89\\
(8,6) & \rightarrow 14.99(8)+16.99(6)=\$221.86
\end{align*}
$$

To make the most revenue, James should make 8 personal cakes and 6 cupcake orders.

### 7.7 Probability and Permutations

<article>

Congratulations! You have won a free trip to Europe. On your trip you have the opportunity to visit 6 different cities. You are responsible for planning your European vacation. How many different ways can you schedule your trip? The answer may surprise you!

![0](media/279.png "Figure 1: This is an example of a **permutation**.")

A **permutation** is an arrangement of objects in a specific order. It is the product of the counting numbers 1 through $n$.

$$
n!=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdot \ldots \cdot 1
$$

How many ways can you visit the European cities? There are 6 choices for the first stop. Once you have visited this city, you cannot return so there are 5 choices for the second stop, and so on.

$$
\underline{6} \cdot \underline{5} \cdot \underline{4} \cdot \underline{3} \cdot \underline{2} \cdot \underline{1}=720
$$

There are 720 different ways to plan your European vacation!

A permutation of $n$ **_objects_** arranged $k$ **_at a time_** is expressed as $_n P_k$.

$$
_n P_k =\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}
$$

**Example 1:** _Evaluate_ $_6P_3$.

**Solution:** This equation asks, “How many ways can 6 objects be chosen 3 at a time?”

There are 6 ways to choose the first object, 5 ways to choose the second object, and 4 ways to choose the third object.

$$
\underline{6} \cdot \underline{5} \cdot \underline{4}=120
$$

There are 120 different ways 6 objects can be chosen 3 at a time.

Example 1 can also be written using the formula for permutation: $_6P_3=\frac{6!}{(6-3)!}=\frac{6!}{3!}=6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4=120$.

Permutations and Graphing Calculators
-------------------------------------

Most graphing calculators have the ability to calculate a permutation.

The letters of the word HOSPITAL are arranged at random. How many different arrangements can be made? What is the probability that the last letter is a vowel?

There are eight ways to choose the first letter, seven ways to choose the second, and so on. The total number of arrangements is 8!= 40,320.

There are three vowels in HOSPITAL; therefore, there are three possibilities for the last letter. Once this letter is chosen, there are seven choices for the first letter, six for the second, and so on.

$$
\underline{7} \cdot \underline{6} \cdot \underline{5} \cdot \underline{4} \cdot \underline{3} \cdot \underline{2} \cdot \underline{1} \cdot \underline{3}=15,120
$$

Probability, as you learned in a previous chapter, has the formula:

$$
\text{Probability} \ (success) = \frac{number \ of \ ways \ to \ get \ success}{total \ number \ of \ possible \ outcomes}
$$

There are 15,120 ways to get a vowel as the last letter; there are 40,320 total combinations.

$$
P(last \ letter \ is \ a \ vowel)=\frac{15,120}{40,320}=\frac{3}{8}
$$

### 7.8 Probability and Combinations

<article>

When the order of objects is not important and/or the objects are replaced, **combinations** are formed.

A **combination** is an arrangement of objects in no particular order.

Consider a sandwich with salami, ham, and turkey. It does not matter the order in which we place the deli meat, as long as it’s on the sandwich.

There is only one way to stack the meat on the sandwich if the order does not matter. However, if the order mattered, there are 3 choices for the first meat, 2 for the second, and one for the last choice: $\underline{3} \cdot \underline{2} \cdot \underline{1}=6$.

![0](media/283.png "Figure 1: $$")
Combination \neq Permutation
$$

A combination of $n$ **_objects_** chosen $k$ **_at a time_** is expressed as $_nC_k$.

$$
_nC_k =\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}= \binom{n}{k}
$$

This is read “$n$ choose $k$.”

**Example 1:** _How many ways can 8 students be chosen from a class of 21?_

**Solution:** It does not matter how the eight students are chosen. Use the formula for combination rather than permutation.

$$
=\frac{21!}{8!(21-8)!}= 203,490
$$

There are 203,490 different ways to choose eight students from 21.

Example: The Senate is made of 100 people, two per state. How many different four-person committees are possible?

Solution: This question does not care how the committee members are chosen; we will use the formula for combination.

$$
\binom{100}{4}=\frac{100!}{4!(100-4)!}=3,921,225 \ ways
$$

That is a lot of possibilities!

Combinations on the Graphing Calculator
---------------------------------------

Just like permutations, most graphing calculators have the capability to calculate combinations. On the TI calculators, use these directions.

* Enter the $n$, or the total to choose from.
* Choose the **\[MATH\]** button, directly below the **\[ALPHA\]** key. Move the cursor once to the left to see this screen:

![0](media/284.png "Figure 2: * Choose option #3, $_nC_r$. Type in the $k$ value, the amount you want to choose.")

![0](media/285.png "Figure 3: Probability and Combinations")
----------------------------

Combinations are used in probability when there is a replacement of objects or the order does not matter.

Suppose you have ten marbles: four blue and six red. You choose three marbles without looking. What is the probability that all three marbles are blue?

$$
\text{Probability} \ (success) = \frac{number \ of \ ways \ to \ get \ success}{total \ number \ of \ possible \ outcomes}
$$

There are $_4C_3$ ways to choose the blue marbles. There are $_{10}C_3$ total combinations.

$$
P(all \ 3 \ marbles \ are \ blue)= \frac{\binom{4}{3}}{\binom{10}{3}} = \frac{4}{120}=\frac{1}{30}
$$

There is approximately 3.33% chance of all three marbles being drawn are blue.

## 8.0 Exponents and Exponential Functions

<article>

Exponential functions occur in daily situations; money in a bank account, population growth, the decay of carbon-14 in living organisms, and even a bouncing ball. Exponential equations involve **exponents**, or the concept of repeated multiplication. This chapter focuses on combining expressions using the properties of exponents. The latter part of this chapter focuses on creating exponential equations and using the models to predict.

![0](media/288.png "Figure 1: 

</article>

### 8.1 Exponential Properties Involving Products

<article>

In this lesson, you will be learning what an exponent is and about the properties and rules of exponents. You will also learn how to use exponents in problem solving.

**Definition:** An **exponent** is a power of a number that shows how many times that number is multiplied by itself.

An example would be $2^3$. You would multiply 2 by itself 3 times, $2 \times 2 \times 2$. The number 2 is the **base** and the number 3 is the **exponent.** The value $2^3$ is called the **power.**

**Example 1:** _Write in exponential form:_ $\alpha \times \alpha \times \alpha \times \alpha$.

**Solution:** You must count the number of times the base, $\alpha$, is being multiplied by itself. It’s being multiplied four times so the solution is $\alpha^4$.

**Note:** There are specific rules you must remember when taking powers of negative numbers.

$$
\begin{align*}
(negative \ number) \times (positive \ number) &= negative \ number\\
(negative \ number) \times (negative \ number) &= positive \ number
\end{align*}
$$

For **even powers** of negative numbers, the answer will always be positive. Pairs can be made with each number and the negatives will be cancelled out.

$$
(-2)^4 = (-2)(-2)(-2)(-2) = (-2)(-2) \cdot (-2)(-2) = +16
$$

For **odd powers** of negative numbers, the answer is always negative. Pairs can be made but there will still be one negative number unpaired, making the answer negative.

$$
(-2)^5 = (-2)(-2)(-2)(-2)(-2) = (-2)(-2) \cdot (-2)(-2) \cdot (-2) = -32
$$

When we multiply the same numbers, each with different powers, it is easier to combine them before solving. This is why we use the **Product of Powers Property.**

**Product of Powers Property:** For all real numbers $\chi, \chi^n \cdot \chi^m = \chi^{n+m}$.

**Example 2:** _Multiply_ $\chi^4 \cdot \chi^5$.

**Solution:** $\chi^4 \cdot \chi^5 = \chi^{4+5} = \chi^9$

**Note** that when you use the product rule you DO NOT MULTIPLY BASES.

Example: $2^2 \cdot 2^3 \neq 4^5$

Another note is that this rule APPLIES ONLY TO TERMS THAT HAVE THE SAME BASE.

Example: $2^2 \cdot 3^3 \neq 6^5$

$$
\begin{align*}
& (x^4)^3 = x^4 \cdot x^4 \cdot x^4 \qquad \qquad 3 \ \text{factors of} \ x \ \text{to the power} \ 4.\\
& \underbrace{(x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x}_{x^4}) \cdot \underbrace{(x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x}_{x^4}) \cdot \underbrace{(x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x}_{x^4})=\underbrace{(x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x)}_{x^{12}}
\end{align*}
$$

This situation is summarized below.

**Power of a Product Property:** For all real numbers $\chi$,

$$
(\chi^n)^m = \chi^{n \cdot m}
$$

The Power of a Product Property is similar to the Distributive Property. Everything inside the parentheses must be taken to the power outside. For example, $(x^2y)^4=(x^2)^4 \cdot (y)^4=x^8y^4$. Watch how it works the long way.

$$
\underbrace{(x \cdot x \cdot y)}_{x^2y} \cdot \underbrace{(x \cdot x \cdot y)}_{x^2y} \cdot \underbrace{(x \cdot x \cdot y)}_{x^2y} \cdot \underbrace{(x \cdot x \cdot y)}_{x^2y}=\underbrace{(x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot y \cdot y \cdot y \cdot y)}_{x^8y4}
$$

The Power of a Product Property does not work if you have a sum or difference inside the parenthesis. For example, $(\chi+\gamma)^2 \neq \chi^2 + \gamma^2$. Because it is an addition equation, it should look like $(\chi+\gamma)(\chi+\gamma)$.

**Example 3:** _Simplify_ $(\chi^2)^3$.

**Solution:** $(\chi^2)^3= \chi^{2\cdot 3} = \chi^6$

### 8.2 Exponential Properties Involving Quotients

<article>

In this lesson, you will learn how to simplify quotients of numbers and variables.

**Quotient of Powers Property:** For all real numbers $\chi, \frac{x^n}{x^m} =\chi^{n-m}$.

When dividing expressions with the same base, keep the base and subtract the exponent in the denominator (bottom) from the exponent in the numerator (top). When we have problems with different bases, we apply the rule separately for each base. To simplify $\frac{x^7}{x^4}$, repeated multiplication can be used.

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{x^7}{x^4} &= \frac{\cancel{x} \cdot \cancel{x} \cdot \cancel{x} \cdot \cancel{x} \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x}{\cancel{x} \cdot \cancel{x} \cdot \cancel{x} \cdot \cancel{x}}=\frac{x \cdot x \cdot x}{1}=x^3\\
\frac{x^5y^3}{x^3y^2} &= \frac{\cancel{x} \cdot \cancel{x} \cdot \cancel{x} \cdot x \cdot x}{\cancel{x} \cdot \cancel{x} \cdot \cancel{x}} \cdot \frac{\cancel{y} \cdot \cancel{y} \cdot y}{\cancel{y} \cdot \cancel{y}}=\frac{x \cdot x}{1} \cdot \frac{y}{1}=x^2 y \ \text{OR} \ \frac{x^5y^3}{x^3y^2}=x^{5-3} \cdot y^{3-2}=x^2y
\end{align*}
$$

**Example 1:** _Simplify each of the following expressions using the_ **_quotient rule._**

(a) $\frac{x^{10}}{x^5}$

(b) $\frac{x^5 \gamma^4}{x^3 \gamma^2}$

**Solution:**

(a) $\frac{x^{10}}{x^5}=\chi^{10-5}=\chi^5$

(b) $\frac{x^5 \gamma^4}{x^3 \gamma^2}=\chi^{5-3} \cdot \gamma^{4-2}=\chi^2 \gamma^2$

**Power of a Quotient Property:** $\left(\frac{\chi^n}{\gamma^m}\right)^p = \frac{\chi^{n \cdot p}}{\gamma^{m \cdot p}}$

The power inside the parenthesis for the numerator and the denominator multiplies with the power outside the parenthesis. The situation below shows why this property is true.

$$
\left(\frac{x^3}{y^2}\right)^4=\left( \frac{x^3}{y^2} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{x^3}{y^2}\right) \cdot \left( \frac{x^3}{y^2} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{x^3}{y^2} \right)=\frac{(x \cdot x \cdot x) \cdot (x \cdot x \cdot x) \cdot (x \cdot x \cdot x) \cdot (x \cdot x \cdot x)}{(y \cdot y) \cdot (y \cdot y) \cdot (y \cdot y) \cdot (y \cdot y)}=\frac{x^{12}}{y^8}
$$

**Example 2:** _Simplify the following expression._

$$
\left( \frac{x^{10}}{\gamma^5} \right)^3
$$

**Solution:** $\left(\frac{x^{10}}{\gamma^5}\right)^3 = \frac{\chi^{10 \cdot 3}}{\gamma^{5 \cdot 3}} = \frac{\chi^{30}}{\gamma^{15}}$

### 8.3 Zero, Negative, and Fractional Exponents

<article>

In the previous lessons, we have dealt with powers that are positive whole numbers. In this lesson, you will learn how to solve expressions when the exponent is zero, negative, or a fractional number.

**Exponents of Zero:** For all real numbers $\chi, \chi \neq 0, \chi^0=1$.

Example: $\frac{\chi^4}{\chi^4} = \chi^{4-4} = \chi^0 = 1$. This example is simplified using the Quotient of Powers Property.

Simplifying Expressions with Negative Exponents
-----------------------------------------------

The next objective is **negative exponents.** When we use the quotient rule and we subtract a greater number from a smaller number, the answer will become negative. The variable and the power will be moved to the denominator of a fraction. You will learn how to write this in an expression.

Example: $\frac{x^4}{x^6} =x^{4-6}=x^{-2}=\frac{1}{x^2}$. Another way to look at this is $\frac{\chi \cdot \chi \cdot \chi \cdot \chi}{\chi \cdot \chi \cdot \chi \cdot \chi \cdot \chi \cdot \chi}$. The four $\chi$s on top will cancel out with four $\chi$s on bottom. This will leave two $\chi$s remaining on the bottom, which makes your answer look like $\frac{1}{\chi^2}$.

**Negative Power Rule for Exponents:** $\frac{1}{\chi^n} = \chi^{-n}$ where $\chi \neq 0$

Example: $\chi^{-6} \gamma^{-2}= \frac{1}{\chi^6} \cdot \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = \frac{1}{\chi^6 \gamma^2}$. The negative power rule for exponents is applied to both variables separately in this example.

**Multimedia Link:** For more help with these types of exponents, watch this http://www.phschool.com/atschool/academy123/english/academy123_content/wl-book-demo/ph-241s.html - PH School video or visit the http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/negative-exponents.html - mathisfun website.

**Example 1:** _Write the following expressions without fractions._

(a) $\frac{2}{x^2}$

(b) $\frac{x^2}{y^3}$

**Solution:**

(a) $\frac{2}{x^2}=2x^{-2}$

(b) $\frac{x^2}{y^3}=x^2y^{-3}$

Notice in Example 1(a), the number 2 is in the numerator. This number is multiplied with $\chi^{-2}$. It could also look like this, $2 \cdot \frac{1}{\chi^2}$ to be better understood.

Simplifying Expressions with Fractional Exponents
-------------------------------------------------

The next objective is to be able to use fractions as exponents in an expression.

**Roots as Fractional Exponents:** $\sqrt[m]{a^n}=a^{\frac{n}{m}}$

Example: $\sqrt{a}=a^{\frac{1}{2}}, \sqrt[3]{a}=a^{\frac{1}{3}}, \sqrt[5]{a^2}=(a^2)^{\frac{1}{5}}=a^{\frac{2}{5}}=a^{\frac{2}{5}}$

**Example 2:** _Simplify the following expressions._

(a) $\sqrt[3]{\chi}$

(b) $\sqrt[4]{\chi^3}$

**Solution:**

(a) $\chi^{\frac{1}{3}}$

(b) $\chi^{\frac{3}{4}}$

It is important when evaluating expressions that you remember the Order of Operations. Evaluate what is inside the parentheses, then evaluate the exponents, then perform multiplication/division from left to right, then perform addition/subtraction from left to right.

**Example 3:** _Evaluate the following expression._

(a) $3 \cdot 5^2 - 10 \cdot 5+1$

**Solution:** $3 \cdot 5^2-10 \cdot 5+1=3 \cdot 25-10 \cdot 5+1=75-50+1=26$

### 8.4 Scientific Notation

<article>

Sometimes in mathematics numbers are huge. They are so huge that we use what is called scientific notation. It is easier to work with such numbers when we shorten their decimal places and multiply them by 10 to a specific power. In this lesson, you will learn how to use scientific notation by hand and on a calculator.

Powers of 10:

$$
\begin{align*}
100,000 &= 10^5\\
10,000 &= 10^4\\
1,000 &= 10^3\\
100 &= 10^2\\
10 &= 10^1
\end{align*}
$$

Using Scientific Notation for Large Numbers
-------------------------------------------

Example: If we divide 643,297 by 100,000 we get 6.43297. If we multiply this quotient by 100,000, we get back to our original number. But we have just seen that 100,000 is the same as $10^5$, so if we multiply 6.43297 by $10^5$, we should also get our original answer. In other words $6.43297 \times 10^5=643,297$ Because there are five zeros, the decimal moves over five places.

Solution: Look at the following examples:

$$
\begin{align*}
2.08 \times 10^4 &= 20,800\\
2.08 \times 10^3 &= 2,080\\
2.08 \times 10^2 &= 208\\
2.08 \times 10^1 &= 20.8\\
2.08 \times 10^0 &= 2.08
\end{align*}
$$

The power tells how many decimal places to move; positive powers mean the decimal moves to the right. A positive 4 means the decimal moves four positions the right.

**Example 1:** _Write in scientific notation._

653,937,000

**Solution:** $653,937,000=6.53937000 \times 100,000,000=6.53937 \times 10^8$

Oftentimes we do not keep more than a few decimal places when using scientific notation and we round the number to the nearest whole number, tenth, or hundredth depending on what the directions say. Rounding Example 1 could look like $6.5 \times 10^8$.

Using Scientific Notation for Small Numbers
-------------------------------------------

We’ve seen that scientific notation is useful when dealing with large numbers. It is also good to use when dealing with extremely small numbers.

Look at the following examples:

$$
\begin{align*}
2.08 \times 10^{-1} &= 0.208\\
2.08 \times 10^{-2} &= 0.0208\\
2.08 \times 10^{-3} &= 0.00208\\
2.08 \times 10^{-4} &= 0.000208
\end{align*}
$$

**Example 2:** _The time taken for a light beam to cross a football pitch is_ 0.0000004 _seconds. Write in scientific notation._

**Solution:** $0.0000004=4 \times 0.0000001=4 \times \frac{1}{10,000,000}=4 \times \frac{1}{10^7}=4 \times 10^{-7}$

Evaluating Expressions Using Scientific Notation
------------------------------------------------

When evaluating expressions with scientific notation, it is easiest to keep the powers of 10 together and deal with them separately.

Example: $(3.2 \times 10^6) \cdot (8.7 \times 10^{11}) = 3.2 \times 8.7 \cdot 10^6 \times 10^{11} = 27.84 \times 10^{17}=2.784 \times 10^1 \times 10^{17} = 2.784 \times 10^{18}$

Solution: It is best to keep one number before the decimal point. In order to do that, we had to make 27.84 become $2.784 \times 10^1$ so we could evaluate the expression more simply.

**Example 3:** _Evaluate the following expression._

(a) $(1.7 \times 10^6) \cdot (2.7 \times 10^{-11})$

(b) $(3.2 \times 10^6) \div (8.7 \times 10^{11})$

**Solution:**

(a) $(1.7 \times 10^6) \cdot (2.7 \times 10^{-11})=1.7 \times 2.7 \cdot 10^6 \times 10^{-11}=4.59 \times 10^{-5}$

(b) $(3.2 \times 10^6) \div (8.7 \times 10^{11})=\frac{3.2 \times 10^6}{8.7 \times 10^{11}}=\frac{3.2}{8.7} \times \frac{10^6}{10^{11}}=0.368 \times 10^{6-11} = 3.68 \times 10^{-1} \times 10^{-5}=3.68 \times 10^{-6}$

You must remember to keep the powers of ten together, and have 1 number before the decimal.

Scientific Notation Using a Calculator
--------------------------------------

Scientific and graphing calculators make scientific notation easier. To compute scientific notation, use the **\[EE\]** button. This is **\[2nd\] \[,\]** on some TI models or $[10^\chi]$, which is **\[2nd\] \[log\]**.

For example to enter $2.6 \times 10^5$ enter 2.6 **\[EE\]** 5.

![0](media/289.png "Figure 1: When you hit **\[ENTER\]** the calculator displays $2.6E5$ if it’s set in **Scientific** mode OR it displays 260,000 if it’s set in **Normal** mode.")

Solving Real-World Problems Using Scientific Notation
-----------------------------------------------------

![0](media/290.png "Figure 2: Example: _The mass of a single lithium atom is approximately one percent of one millionth of one billionth of one billionth of one kilogram. Express this mass in scientific notation._")

Solution: We know that percent means we divide by 100, and so our calculation for the mass (in kg) is $\frac{1}{100} \times \frac{1}{1,000,000} \times \frac{1}{1,000,000,000} \times \frac{1}{1,000,000,000} = 10^{-2} \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-9} \times 10^{-9}$

Next, we use the product of powers rule we learned earlier in the chapter.

$$
10^{-2} \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-9} \times 10^{-9}=10^{((-2)+(-6)+(-9)+(-9))}=10^{-26} \ kg.
$$

The mass of one lithium atom is approximately $1 \times 10^{-26} \ kg$.

### 8.5 Exponential Growth Functions

<article>

In previous lessons, we have seen the variable as the base. In exponential functions, the exponent is the variable and the base is a constant.

**General Form of an Exponential Function:** $y=a (b)^x$, where $a=$ _initial value_ and

$$
b= growth \ factor
$$

In exponential growth situations, the growth factor must be greater than one.

$$
b>1
$$

Example: _A colony of bacteria has a population of 3,000 at noon on Sunday. During the next week, the colony’s population doubles every day. What is the population of the bacteria colony at noon on Saturday?_

![0](media/291.png "Figure 1: Solution: Make a table of values and calculate the population each day.")

| **Day** | **0 (Sun)** | **1 (Mon)** | **2 (Tues)** | **3 (Wed)** | **4 (Thurs)** | **5 (Fri)** | **6 (Sat)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Population (thousands) | 3   | 6   | 12  | 24  | 48  | 96  | 192 |

To get the population of bacteria for the next day we multiply the current day’s population by 2 because it doubles every day. If we define $x$ as the number of days since Sunday at noon, then we can write the following: $P= 3 \cdot 2^x$. This is a formula that we can use to calculate the population on any day. For instance, the population on Saturday at noon will be $P = 3 \cdot 2^6=3 \cdot 64 = 192$ thousand bacteria. We use $x=6$, since Saturday at noon is six days after Sunday at noon.

Graphing Exponential Functions
------------------------------

Example: Graph the equation using a table of values $y=2^x$.

Solution: Make a table of values that includes both negative and positive values of $x$. Substitute these values for $x$ to get the value for the $y$ variable.

| $x$ | $y$ |
| --- | --- |
| –3  | $\frac{1}{8}$ |
| –2  | $\frac{1}{4}$ |
| –1  | $\frac{1}{2}$ |
| 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 2   |
| 2   | 4   |
| 3   | 8   |

Plot the points on the coordinate axes to get the graph below. Exponential functions always have this basic shape: They start very small and then once they start growing, they grow faster and faster, and soon they become huge.

![0](media/292.png "Figure 2: Comparing Graphs of Exponential Functions")
-----------------------------------------

The shape of the exponential graph changes if the constants change. The curve can become steeper or shallower.

Earlier in the lesson, we produced a graph for $y=2^x$. Let’s compare that graph with the graph of $y = 3 \cdot 2^x$.

| $x$ | $y$ |
| --- | --- |
| –2  | $3 \cdot 2^{-2} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{2^2}  =\frac{3}{4}$ |
| –1  | $3 \cdot 2^{-1} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{2^1}  = \frac{3}{2}$ |
| 0   | $3 \cdot 2^0 = 3$ |
| 1   | $3 \cdot 2^1 = 6$ |
| 2   | $3 \cdot 2^2 = 3 \cdot 4 = 12$ |
| 3   | $3 \cdot 2^3 = 3 \cdot 8 = 24$ |

We can see that the function $y=3 \cdot 2^x$ is bigger than the function $y=2^x$. In both functions, the value of $y$ doubles every time $x$ increases by one. However, $y=3 \cdot 2^x$ starts with a value of 3, while $y=2^x$ starts with a value of 1, so it makes sense that $y=3 \cdot 2^x$ would be bigger.

![0](media/293.png "Figure 3: Solving Real-World Problems with Exponential Growth")
---------------------------------------------------

Example: _The population of a town is estimated to increase by 15% per year. The population today is 20,000. Make a graph of the population function and find out what the population will be ten years from now._

![0](media/294.png "Figure 4: Solution: The population is growing at a rate of 15% each year. When something grows at a percent, this is a clue to use **exponential functions.**")

Remember, the general form of an exponential function is $y=a(b)^x$, where $a$ is the beginning value and $b$ is the total growth rate. The beginning value is 20,000. Therefore, $a=20,000$.

The population is keeping the original number of people and adding 15% more each year.

$$
100\%+15\%=115\%=1.15
$$

Therefore, the population is growing at a rate of 115% each year. Thus, $b=1.15$.

The function to represent this situation is $y=20,000 \ (1.15)^x$.

Now make a table of values and graph the function.

| $x$ | $y = 20 \cdot (1.15)^x$ |
| --- | --- |
| **–10** | 4.9 |
| **–5** | 9.9 |
| **0** | 20  |
| **5** | 40.2 |
| **10** | 80.9 |

![0](media/295.png "Figure 5: Notice that we used negative values of $x$ in our table. Does it make sense to think of negative time? In this case $x=-5$ represents what the population was five years ago, so it can be useful information.")

The question asked in the problem was _“What will be the population of the town ten years from now?”_ To find the population exactly, we use $x=10$ in the formula. We find $y=20,000 \cdot (1.15)^{10}=80,912$.

### 8.6 Exponential Decay Functions

<article>

In the last lesson, we learned how to solve expressions that modeled exponential growth. In this lesson, we will be learning about exponential decay functions.

**General Form of an Exponential Function:** $y=a (b)^x$, where $a=$ _initial value_ and

$$
b = growth \ factor
$$

In exponential decay situations, the growth factor must be a fraction between zero and one.

$$
0 < b < 1
$$

Example: _For her fifth birthday, Nadia’s grandmother gave her a full bag of candy. Nadia counted her candy and found out that there were 160 pieces in the bag. Nadia loves candy, so she ate half the bag on the first day. Her mother told her that if she continues to eat at that rate, it will be gone the next day and she will not have any more until her next birthday. Nadia devised a clever plan. She will always eat half of the candy that is left in the bag each day. She thinks that she will get candy every day and her candy will never run out. How much candy does Nadia have at the end of the week? Would the candy really last forever?_

![0](media/296.png "Figure 1: Solution: Make a table of values for this problem.")

| **Day** | **0** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **7** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **\# of Candies** | 160 | 80  | 40  | 20  | 10  | 5   | 2.5 | 1.25 |

You can see that if Nadia eats half the candies each day, then by the end of the week she has only 1.25 candies left in her bag.

Write an equation for this exponential function. Nadia began with 160 pieces of candy. In order to get the amount of candy left at the end of each day, we keep multiplying by $\frac{1}{2}$. Because it is an exponential function, the equation is:

$$
y=160 \cdot \frac{1}{2}^x
$$

Graphing Exponential Decay Functions
------------------------------------

Example: _Graph the exponential function_ $y=5 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^x$.

Solution: Start by making a table of values. Remember when you have a number to the negative power, you are simply taking the reciprocal of that number and taking it to the positive power. Example: $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{-2}  = \left(\frac{2}{1}\right)^2  = 2^2$.

| $x$ | $y=5 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^x$ |
| --- | --- |
| –3  | $y =5 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{-3}=40$ |
| –2  | $y =5 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{-2}=20$ |
| –1  | $y =5 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{-1}=10$ |
| 0   | $y =5 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^0=5$ |
| 1   | $y =5 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^1=\frac{5}{2}$ |
| 2   | $y =5 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2=\frac{5}{4}$ |

Now graph the function.

![0](media/297.png "Figure 2: Using the Property of Negative Exponents, the equation can also be written as $5 \cdot 2^{-x}$.")

Comparing Graphs of Exponential Decay Functions
-----------------------------------------------

Exponential growth and decay graphs look like opposites and can sometimes be mirror images.

Example: _Graph the functions_ $y=4^x$ _and_ $4^{-x}$ _on the same coordinate axes._

Solution: Here is the table of values and the graph of the two functions.

Looking at the values in the table, we see that the two functions are “reverse images” of each other in the sense that the values for the two functions are reciprocals.

| $x$ | $y=4^x$ | $y=4^{-x}$ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| –3  | $y=4^{-3} = \frac{1}{64}$ | $y=4^{-(-3)} = 64$ |
| –2  | $y=4^{-2} = \frac{1}{16}$ | $y=4^{-(-2)} = 16$ |
| –1  | $y=4^{-1} = \frac{1}{4}$ | $y=4^{-(-1)} = 4$ |
| 0   | $y=4^0 = 1$ | $y=4^{-(0)} = 1$ |
| 1   | $y=4^1 = 4$ | $y=4^{-(1)} =\frac{1}{4}$ |
| 2   | $y=4^2 = 16$ | $y=4^{-(2)} =\frac{1}{16}$ |
| 3   | $y=4^3 = 64$ | $y=4^{-(3)} = \frac{1}{64}$ |

Here is the graph of the two functions. Notice that these two functions are mirror images if the mirror is placed vertically on the $y-$axis.

![0](media/298.png "Figure 3: Solving Real-World Problems Involving Exponential Decay Functions")
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Example: _The cost of a new car is_ $32,000. _It depreciates at a rate of_ 15% _per year. This means that it loses_ 15% _of its value each year._

* _Draw the graph of the car’s value against time in years._
* _Find the formula that gives the value of the car in terms of time._
* _Find the value of the car when it is four years old._

Solution: Start by making a table of values. To fill in the values we start with 32,000 when $t=0$. Then we multiply the value of the car by 85% for each passing year. (Since the car loses 15% of its value, it keeps 85% of its value). Remember $85. =0.85$.

| **Time** | **Value (Thousands)** |
| --- | --- |
| 0   | 32  |
| 1   | 27.2 |
| 2   | 23.1 |
| 3   | 19.7 |
| 4   | 16.7 |
| 5   | 14.2 |

![0](media/299.png "Figure 4: The general formula is $y=a (b)^x$.")

In this case: $y$ is the value of the car, $x$ is the time in years, $a=32,000$ is the starting amount in thousands, and $b=0.85$ since we multiply the value in any year by this factor to get the value of the car in the following year. The formula for this problem is $y=32,000 (0.85)^x$.

Finally, to find the value of the car when it is four years old, we use $x=4$ in the formula. Remember the value is in thousands.

$$
y=32,000(0.85)^4=16,704.
$$

### 8.7 Geometric Sequences and Exponential Functions

<article>

_Which would you prefer: being given one million dollars, or one penny the first day, double that penny the next day, and then double the previous day's pennies and so on for a month?_

At first glance you would think that a million dollars would be more. However, let’s use geometric sequences before we decide to see how the pennies add up. You start with a penny the first day and keep doubling each day until the end of the month (30 days).

$$
\begin{align*}
1^{st} \ \text{Day} && 1 \ \text{penny} & = 2^0\\
2^{nd} \ \text{Day} && 2 \ \text{pennies} &  = 2^1\\
3^{rd} \ \text{Day} && 4 \ \text{pennies} & = 2^2\\
4^{th} \ \text{Day} && 8 \ \text{pennies} & = 2^3\\
30^{th} \ \text{Day} && & = 2^{29}
\end{align*}
$$

![0](media/300.png "Figure 1: $2^{29} =536,870,912$ pennies or $5,368,709, which is well over five times greater than $1,000,000.00.")

**Geometric Sequence:** a sequence of numbers in which each number in the sequence is found by multiplying the previous number by a fixed amount called the common ratio.

$n^{th}$ term in a geometric sequence $a_n= a_1 r^{n-1}$ ($a_1 =$ first term, $r =$ common ratio)

The Common Ratio of a Geometric Sequence
----------------------------------------

The common ratio, $r$, in any geometric sequence can be found by dividing any term by the preceding term. If we know the common ratio in a sequence then we can find any term in the sequence.

**Example 1:** _Find the eighth term in the geometric sequence._

1, 2, 4,...

**Solution** First we need to find the common ratio $r=\frac{2}{1}=2$.

The eighth term is given by the formula $2=1 \cdot 2^7=128$.

In other words, to get the eighth term we started with the first term, which is 1, and multiplied by two seven times.

Graphing Geometric Sequences
----------------------------

Exponential graphs and geometric sequence graphs look very much alike. Exponential graphs are continuous, however, and the sequence graphs are discrete with distinct points ($1^{st}$ term and $2^{nd}$ term, etc).

Example: _A population of bacteria in a Petri dish increases by a factor of three every 24 hours. The starting population is 1 million bacteria. This means that on the first day the population increases to 3 million on the second day to 9 million and so on._

Solution: The population of bacteria is continuous. Even though we measured the population only every 24 hours, we know that it does not get from 1 million to 3 million all at once. Rather, the population changes bit by bit over the 24 hours. In other words, the bacteria are always there, and you can, if you so wish, find out what the population is at any time during a 24-hour period.

When we graph an exponential function, we draw the graph with a solid curve to show the function has values at any time during the day. On the other hand, when we graph a geometric sequence, we draw discrete points to show the sequence has value only at those points but not in between.

Here are graphs for the two examples previously given:

![0](media/301.png "Figure 2: Solving Real-World Problems Involving Geometric Sequences")
---------------------------------------------------------

Example: _A courtier presented the Indian king with a beautiful, hand-made chessboard. The king asked what he would like in return for his gift and the courtier surprised the king by asking for one grain of rice on the first square, two grains on the second, four grains on the third, etc. The king readily agreed and asked for the rice to be brought (from Meadows et al. 1972, p.29 via Porritt 2005). How many grains of rice does the king have to put on the last square?_

![0](media/302.png "Figure 3: Solution: A chessboard is an $8 \times 8$ square grid, so it contains a total of 64 squares.")

The courtier asked for one grain of rice on the first square, 2 grains of rice on the second square, 4 grains of rice on the third square and so on. We can write this as a geometric sequence.

1, 2, 4,...

The numbers double each time, so the common ratio is $r=2$.

The problem asks how many grains of rice the king needs to put on the last square. What we need to find is the $64^{th}$ term in the sequence. This means multiplying the starting term, 1, by the common ratio 64 times in a row. Let’s use the formula.

$a_n=a_1 r^{n-1}$, where $a_n$ is the $n^{th}$ term, $a_1$ Is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio.

$a_{64}=1 \cdot 2^{63}=9, 223, 372, 036, 854, 775, 808$ grains of rice.

### 8.8 Problem-Solving Strategies

<article>

We have to deal with problem solving in everyday life. Therefore, it is important to know the steps you must take when problem solving.

Example: _Suppose $4000 is invested at a 6% interest rate compounded annually. How much money will there be in the bank at the end of five years? At the end of 20 years?_

Solution: Read the problem and summarize the information.

$4000 is invested at a 6% interest rate compounded annually. We want to know how much money we have after five years.

* Assign variables. Let $x=$ _time in years_ and $y=$ _amount of money in investment account_.
* We start with $4000 and each year we apply a 6% interest rate on the amount in the bank.
* The pattern is that each year we multiply the previous amount by the factor of $100\%+6\%=106\%=1.06$.
* Complete a table of values.

| **Time (years)** | **0** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Investment Amount ($)** | 4000 | 4240 | 4494.40 | 4764.06 | 5049.91 | 5352.90 |

Using the table, we see that at the end of five years we have $5352.90 in the investment account.

In the case of five years, we don’t need an equation to solve the problem. However, if we want the amount at the end of 20 years, it becomes too difficult to constantly multiply. We can use a formula instead.

Since we take the original investment and keep multiplying by the same factor of 1.06, that means we can use exponential notation.

$$
y=4000 \cdot (1.06)^x
$$

To find the amount after five years we use $x=5$ in the equation.

$$
y=4000 \cdot (1.06)^5=\$ 5352.90
$$

To find the amount after 20 years we use $x=20$ in the equation.

$$
y=4000 \cdot (1.06)^{20}=\$ 12,828.54
$$

To check our answers we can plug in some low values of $x$ to see if they match the values in the table:

$$
\begin{align*}
& x = 0 && 4000 \cdot (1.06)0 = 4000\\
& x = 1	&& 4000 \cdot (1.06)1 = 4240\\
& x = 2	&& 4000 \cdot (1.06)2 = 4494.40
\end{align*}
$$

The answers make sense because after the first year, the amount goes up by $240 (6% of $4000). The amount of increase gets larger each year and that makes sense because the interest is 6% of an amount that is larger and larger every year.

## 9.0 Polynomials and Factoring; More on Probability

<article>

This chapter will present a new type of function: the **polynomial.** Chances are, polynomials will be new to you. However, polynomials are used in many careers and real life situations - to model the population of a city over a century, to predict the price of gasoline, and to predict the volume of a solid. This chapter will also present basic **factoring** - breaking a polynomial into its linear factors. This will help you solve many quadratic equations found in Chapter 10.

### 9.1 Addition and Subtraction of Polynomials

<article>

So far we have discussed linear functions and exponential functions. This lesson introduces polynomial functions.

**Definition:** A **polynomial** is an expression made with constants, variables, and _positive integer_ exponents of the variables.

An example of a polynomial is: $4x^3 + 2x^2 - 3x + 1$. There are four terms: $4x^3, \ 2x^2, \ 3x,$ and 1. The numbers appearing in each term in front of the variable are called the **coefficients.** 4, 2, and 3 are coefficients because those numbers are in front of a variable. The number appearing all by itself without a variable is called a **constant.** 1 is the constant because it is by itself.

**Example 1:** _Identify the following expressions as polynomials or non-polynomials._

(a) $5x^2 - 2x$

(b) $3x^2 - 2x^{-2}$

(c) $x\sqrt{x} - 1$

(d) $\frac{5}{x^3 + 1}$

(e) $4x^{\frac{1}{3}}$

(f) $4xy^2 - 2x^2y - 3 + y^3 - 3x^3$

**Solution:**

(a) $5x^2 - 2x$ This **_is_** a polynomial.

(b) $3x^2 - 2x^{-2}$ This is **_not_** a polynomial because it has a negative exponent.

(c) $x\sqrt{x} - 1$ This is **_not_** a polynomial because it has a square root.

(d) $\frac{5}{x^3 + 1}$ This is **_not_** a polynomial because the power of $x$ appears in the denominator.

(e) $4x^{\frac{1}{3}}$ This is **_not_** a polynomial because it has a fractional exponent.

(f) $4xy^2 - 2x^y - 3 + y^3 - 3x^3$ This **_is_** a polynomial.

Classifying Polynomials by Degree
---------------------------------

The **degree** of a polynomial is the largest exponent of a single term.

* $4x^3$ has a degree of 3 and is called a **cubic term** or $3^{rd}$ **order term**.
* $2x^2$ has a degree of 2 and is called a **quadratic term** or $2^{nd}$ **order term**.
* $-3x$ has a degree of 1 and is called a **linear term** or $1^{st}$ **order term.**
* 1 has a degree of 0 because there is no variable.

Polynomials can have more than one variable. Here is another example of a polynomial: $t^4-6s^3t^2-12st+4s^4-5$. This is a polynomial because all exponents on the variables are positive integers. This polynomial has five terms. **Note:** _The degree of a term is the sum of the powers on each variable in the term._

$t^4$ has a degree of 4, so it’s a $4^{th}$ order term.

$-6s^3t^2$ has a degree of 5, so it’s a $5^{th}$ order term.

$-12^{st}$ has a degree of 2, so it’s a $2^{nd}$ order term.

$4s^4$ has a degree of 4, so it’s a $4^{th}$ order term.

–5 is a constant, so its degree is 0.

Since the highest degree of a term in this polynomial is 5, this is a polynomial of degree 5 or a $5^{th}$ order polynomial.

**Example 2:** _Identify the coefficient on each term, the degree of each term, and the degree of the polynomial._

$$
x^4-3x^3y^2+8x-12
$$

**Solution:** The coefficients of each term in order are 1, –3, 8 and the constant is –12.

The degrees of each term are 4, 5, 1, and 0. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial is 5.

A **monomial** is a one-termed polynomial. It can be a constant, a variable, or a combination of constants and variables. Examples of monomials are: $b^2; \ 6; \ -2ab^2; \ \frac{1}{4} x^2$

Rewriting Polynomials in Standard Form
--------------------------------------

Often, we arrange the terms in a polynomial in **standard from** in which the term with the highest degree is first and is followed by the other terms in order of decreasing power. The first term of a polynomial in this form is called the _leading term_, and the coefficient in this term is called the _leading coefficient_.

**Example 3:** _Rearrange the terms in the following polynomials so that they are in standard form. Indicate the leading term and leading coefficient of each polynomial._

(a) $7-3x^3+4x$

(b) $ab-a^3+2b$

**Solution:**

(a) $7-3x^3+4x$ is rearranged as $-3x^3+4x+7$. The leading term is $-3x^3$ and the leading coefficient is –3.

(b) $ab-a^3+2b$ is rearranged as $-a^3+ab+2b$. The leading term is $-a^3$ and the leading coefficient is –1.

Simplifying Polynomials
-----------------------

A polynomial is simplified if it has no terms that are alike. **Like terms** are terms in the polynomial that have the same variable(s) with the same exponents, but they can have different coefficients.

$2x^2y$ and $5x^2y$ are like terms.

$6x^2y$ and $6xy^2$ are not like terms.

If we have a polynomial that has like terms, we simplify by combining them.

$$
\begin{align*}
& x^2 + \underline{6xy}-\underline{4xy} + y^2\\
& \qquad \nearrow \qquad \nwarrow\\
& \qquad \text{Like terms}
\end{align*}
$$

This polynomial is simplified by combining the like terms $6xy-4xy=2xy$. We write the simplified polynomial as $x^2+2xy+y^2$.

**Example 4:** _Simplify by collecting and combining like terms._

$$
a^3b^3 - 5ab^4 + 2a^3b - a^3b^3 + 3ab^4 - a^2b
$$

**Solution:** Use the Commutative Property of Addition to reorganize like terms then simplify.

$$
\begin{align*}
& = (a^3b^3-a^3b^3) + (-5ab^4+3ab^4) + 2a^3b-a^2b\\
& = 0-2ab^4+2a^3b-a^2b\\
& = -2ab^4+2a^3 b-a^2 b
\end{align*}
$$

Adding and Subtracting Polynomials
----------------------------------

To add or subtract polynomials, you have to group the like terms together and combine them to simplify.

**Example 5:** _Add and simplify_ $3x^2-4x+7$ _and_ $2x^3-4x^2-6x+5$.

**Solution:** Add $3x^2-4x+7$ and $2x^3-4x^2-6x+5$.

$$
\begin{align*}
(3x^2-4x+7)+(2x^3-4x^2-6x+5)&=2x^3+(3x^2-4x^2 )+(-4x-6x)+(7+5)\\
&=2x^3-x^2-10x+12
\end{align*}
$$

**Multimedia Link:** For more explanation of polynomials, visit http://www.purplemath.com/modules/polydefs.htm - Purplemath’s website.

**Example 6:** _Subtract_ $5b^2-2a^2$ _from_ $4a^2-8ab-9b^2$.

**Solution:**

$$
\begin{align*}
(4a^2-8ab-9b^2)-(5b^2-2a^2)&=[(4a^2- (-2a^2)]+(-9b^2-5b^2)-8ab\\
& = 6a^2-14b^2-8ab
\end{align*}
$$

Solving Real-World Problems Using Addition or Subtraction of Polynomials
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Polynomials are useful for finding the areas of geometric objects. In the following examples, you will see this usefulness in action.

**Example 7:** _Write a polynomial that represents the area of each figure shown._

(a) ![0](media/304.png "Figure 1: (b) ![0](media/305.png)")

\[Figure 2\]

**Solution:** The blue square has area: $y \cdot y=y^2$.

The yellow square has area: $x \cdot x = x^2$.

The pink rectangles each have area: $x \cdot y =xy$.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Test area} & = y^2+x^2+xy+xy\\
& = y^2 + x^2 + 2xy
\end{align*}
$$

To find the area of the green region we find the area of the big square and subtract the area of the little square.

The big square has area $y \cdot y =y^2$.

The little square has area $x \cdot x = x^2$.

_Area of the green region_ $= y^2-x^2$

### 9.2 Multiplication of Polynomials

<article>

When multiplying polynomials together, we must remember the exponent rules we learned in the last chapter, such as the Product Rule. This rule says that if we multiply expressions that have the same base, we just add the exponents and keep the base unchanged. If the expressions we are multiplying have coefficients and more than one variable, we multiply the coefficients just as we would any number. We also apply the product rule on each variable separately.

Example: $(2x^2 y^3) \times (3x^2 y)=(2\cdot3) \times (x^2 \cdot x^2) \times (y^3 \cdot y)=6x^4 y^4$

Multiplying a Polynomial by a Monomial
--------------------------------------

This is the simplest of polynomial multiplications. Problems are like that of the one above.

**Example 1:** _Multiply the following monomials._

(a) $(2x^2)(5x^3)$

(c) $(3xy^5)(-6x^4y^2)$

(d) $(-12a^2b^3c^4)(-3a^2b^2)$

**Solution:**

(a) $(2x^2)(5x^3)=(2 \cdot 5)\cdot (x^2 \cdot x^3) = 10x^{2+3}=10x^5$

(c) $(3xy^5)(-6x^4y^2)=-18x^{1+4}y^{5+2}=-18x^5y^7$

(d) $(-12a^2b^3c^4)(-3a^2b^2) = 36a^{2+2}b^{3+2}c^4=36a^4b^5c^4$

To multiply monomials, we use the **Distributive Property.**

**Distributive Property:** For any expressions $a, \ b$, and $c$, $a(b+c)=ab+ac$.

This property can be used for numbers as well as variables. This property is best illustrated by an area problem. We can find the area of the big rectangle in two ways.

![0](media/310.png "Figure 1: One way is to use the formula for the area of a rectangle.")

$$
\begin{align*}
Area \ of \ the \ big \ rectangle & = Length \times Width\\
Length & = a, \ Width = b + c\\
Area & = a \times (b + c)
\end{align*}
$$

The area of the big rectangle can also be found by adding the areas of the two smaller rectangles.

$$
\begin{align*}
Area \ of \ red \ rectangle & = ab\\
Area \ of \ blue \ rectangle & = ac\\
Area \ of \ big \ rectangle & = ab + ac
\end{align*}
$$

This means that $a(b+c)=ab+ac$.

In general, if we have a number or variable in front of a parenthesis, this means that each term in the parenthesis is multiplied by the expression in front of the parenthesis.

$a(b+c+d+e+f+\ldots)=ab+ac+ad+ae+af+ \ldots$ The “...” means “and so on.”

**Example 2:** _Multiply $2x^3 y(-3x^4 y^2+2x^3 y-10x^2+7x+9)$._

**Solution:**

$$
\begin{align*}
& 2x^3 y(-3x^4 y^2+2x^3 y-10x^2+7x+9)\\
& = (2x^3 y)(-3x^4 y^2 )+(2x^3 y)(2x^3 y)+(2x^3 y)(-10x^2 )+(2x^3 y)(7x)+(2x^3 y)(9)\\
& = -6x^7 y^3+4x^6 y^2-20x^5 y+14x^4 y+18x^3 y
\end{align*}

--------------------------------------

A binomial is a polynomial with two terms. The Distributive Property also applies for multiplying binomials. Let’s think of the first parentheses as one term. The Distributive Property says that the term in front of the parentheses multiplies with each term inside the parentheses separately. Then, we add the results of the products.

$(a+b)(c+d)=(a+b)\cdot c+(a+b)\cdot d$ Let’s rewrite this answer as $c\cdot (a+b)+d\cdot (a+b)$

We see that we can apply the Distributive Property on each of the parentheses in turn.

$$
c \cdot (a+b)+d\cdot (a+b)=c\cdot a+c \cdot b+d \cdot a+d \cdot b \ (\text{or} \ ca+cb+da+db)
$$

What you should notice is that when multiplying any two polynomials, **every term in one polynomial is multiplied by every term in the other polynomial**.

Example: _Multiply and simplify $(2x+1)(x+3)$._

Solution: We must multiply each term in the first polynomial with each term in the second polynomial. First, multiply the first term in the first parentheses by all the terms in the second parentheses.

![0](media/311.png "Figure 2: Now we multiply the second term in the first parentheses by all terms in the second parentheses and add them to the previous terms.")

![0](media/312.png "Figure 3: Now we can simplify.")

$$
\begin{align*}
(2x)(x)+(2x)(3)+(1)(x)+(1)(3) & = 2x^2+6x+x+3\\
& = 2x^2+7x+3
\end{align*}
$$

**Example 3:** _Multiply and simplify_ $(4x-5)(x-20)$.

**Solution:**

$$
\begin{align*}
(4x)(x)+(4x)(-20)+(-5)(x)+(-5)(-20)&=4x^2-80x-5x+100\\
& = 4x^2-85x+100
\end{align*}
$$

Solving Real-World Problems Using Multiplication of Polynomials
---------------------------------------------------------------

We can use multiplication to find the area and volume of geometric shapes. Look at these examples.

**Example 4**: _Find the area of the following figure._

![0](media/313.png "Figure 4: Solution: We use the formula for the area of a rectangle: $\text{Area}=\text{length}\cdot\text{width}$. For the big rectangle:")

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Length} & = B+3, \ \text{Width}=B+2\\
\text{Area} &= (B+3)(B+2)\\
& = B^2+2B+3B+6\\
& = B^2+5B+6
\end{align*}
$$

**Example 5**: _Find the volume of the following figure._

![0](media/314.png "Figure 5: Solution:")

$$
\begin{align*}
The \ volume \ of \ this \ shape & = (area \ of \ the \ base) \cdot (height).\\
\text{Area of the base} & = x(x+2)\\
& = x^2+2x
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
Volume&=(area \ of \ base ) \times height\\
Volume&=(x^2+2x)(2x+1)
\end{align*}
$$

### 9.3 Special Products of Polynomials

<article>

When we multiply two linear (degree of 1) binomials, we create a quadratic (degree of 2) polynomial with four terms. The middle terms are like terms so we can combine them and simplify to get a quadratic or $2^{nd}$ degree **trinomial** (polynomial with three terms). In this lesson, we will talk about some special products of binomials.

Finding the Square of a Binomial
--------------------------------

A special binomial product is the **square of a binomial**. Consider the following multiplication: $(x+4)(x+4)$. We are multiplying the same expression by itself, which means that we are squaring the expression. This means that:

$$
\begin{align*}
(x+4)(x+4) & = (x+4)^2\\
(x+4)(x+4) & = x^2+4x+4x+16=x^2+8x+16
\end{align*}
$$

This follows the general pattern of the following rule.

**Square of a Binomial:** $(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2$, _and_ $(a-b)^2=a^2-2ab+b^2$

Stay aware of the common mistake $(a+b)^2=a^2+b^2$. To see why $(a+b)^2 \neq a^2+b^2$, try substituting numbers for $a$ and $b$ into the equation (for example, $a=4$ and $b=3$), and you will see that it is _not_ a true statement. The middle term, $2ab$, is needed to make the equation work.

**Example 1:** _Simplify by multiplying:_ $(x+10)^2$.

**Solution:** Use the square of a binomial formula, substituting $a=x$ and $b=10$

$$
\begin{align*}
(a+b)^2&=a^2+2ab+b^2\\
(x+10)^2 & =(x)^2+2(x)(10)+(10)^2=x^2+20x+100
\end{align*}
$$

Finding the Product of Binomials Using Sum and Difference Patterns
------------------------------------------------------------------

Another special binomial product is the product of a sum and a difference of terms. For example, let’s multiply the following binomials.

$$
\begin{align*}
(x+4)(x-4) & = x^2-4x+4x-16\\
& = x^2-16
\end{align*}
$$

Notice that the middle terms are opposites of each other, so they cancel out when we collect like terms. This always happens when we multiply a sum and difference of the same terms.

$$
\begin{align*}
(a+b)(a-b)&=a^2-ab+ab-b^2\\
& =a^2-b^2
\end{align*}
$$

When multiplying a sum and difference of the same two terms, the middle terms cancel out. We get the square of the first term minus the square of the second term. You should remember this formula.

**Sum and Difference Formula:** $(a+b)(a-b) = a^2-b^2$

**Example 2:** _Multiply the following binomial and simplify._

$$
(5x+9)(5x-9)
$$

**Solution:** Use the above formula, substituting $a=5x$ and $b=9$. Multiply.

$$
(5x+9)(5x-9)=(5x)^2-(9)^2=25x^2-81
$$

Solving Real-World Problems Using Special Products of Polynomials
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Let’s now see how special products of polynomials apply to geometry problems and to mental arithmetic. Look at the following example.

![0](media/319.png "Figure 1: Example: _Find the area of the square._")

Solution: $The \ area \ of \ the \ square = side \times side$

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Area} & = (a+b)(a+b)\\
& = a^2+2ab+b^2
\end{align*}
$$

Notice that this gives a visual explanation of the square of binomials product.

$Area \ of \ big \ square: (a+b)^2 = Area \ of \ blue \ square = a^2+2 \ (area \ of \ yellow) = 2ab + area \ of \ red \ square = b^2$

The next example shows how to use the special products in doing fast mental calculations.

**Example 3:** _Find the products of the following numbers without using a calculator._

(a) $43 \times 57$

(b) $45^2$

**Solution:** The key to these mental “tricks” is to rewrite each number as a sum or difference of numbers you know how to square easily.

(a) Rewrite $43=(50-7)$ and $57=(50+7)$.

Then $43 \times 57 = (50-7)(50+7) = (50)^2-(7)^2=2500-49=2,451$.

(b) $45^2 = (40+5)^2 = (40)^2+2(40)(5) +(5)^2 = 1600+400+25=2,025$

### 9.4 Polynomial Equations in Factored Form

<article>

We have been multiplying polynomials by using the Distributive Property, where all the terms in one polynomial must be multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. In this lesson, you will start learning how to do this process using a different method called **factoring**.

**Factoring:** Take the factors that are common to all the terms in a polynomial. Then multiply the common factors by a parenthetical expression containing all the terms that are left over when you divide out the common factors.

![0](media/321.png "Figure 1: Let’s look at the areas of the rectangles again: $Area = length \times width$. The total area of the figure on the right can be found in two ways.")

**Method 1:** Find the areas of all the small rectangles and add them.

Blue rectangle $= ab$

Orange rectangle $= ac$

Red rectangle $=ad$

Green rectangle $=ae$

Purple rectangle $=2a$

Total area $=ab+ac+ad+ae+2a$

**Method 2:** Find the area of the big rectangle all at once.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Length} & = a\\
\text{Width} & = b+c+d+e+2\\
\text{Area} & = a(b+c+d+e=2)
\end{align*}
$$

The answers are the same no matter which method you use:

$$
ab+ac+ad+ae+2a=a(b+c+d+e+2)
$$

Using the Zero Product Property
-------------------------------

Polynomials can be written in **expanded form** or in **factored form**. Expanded form means that you have sums and differences of different terms:

$$
6x^4+7x^3-26x^2-17x+30
$$

Notice that the degree of the polynomial is four.

The **factored form** of a polynomial means it is written as a product of its factors.

The factors are also polynomials, usually of lower degree. Here is the same polynomial in factored form.

$$
(x-1)(x+2)(2x-3)(3x+5)
$$

Suppose we want to know where the polynomial $6x^4+7x^3-26x^2-17x+30$ equals zero. It is quite difficult to solve this using the methods we already know. However, we can use the Zero Product Property to help.

**Zero Product Property:** The only way a product is zero is if one or both of the terms are zero.

By setting the factored form of the polynomial equal to zero and using this property, we can easily solve the original polynomial.

$$
(x-1)(x+2)(2x-3)(3x+5)=0
$$

According to the property, for the original polynomial to equal zero, we have to set each term equal to zero and solve.

$$
\begin{align*}
(x-1)&=0 \rightarrow x=1\\
(x+2)&=0 \rightarrow x=-2\\
(2x-3)&=0 \rightarrow x=\frac{3}{2}\\
(3x+5)&=0 \rightarrow x=-\frac{5}{3}
\end{align*}
$$

The solutions to $6x^4+7x^3-26x^2-17x+30=0$ are $x=-2,-\frac{5}{3},1,\frac{3}{2}$.

**Example 2:** _Solve_ $(x-9)(3x+4)=0$.

**Solution:** Separate the factors using the Zero Product Property: $(x-9)(3x+4)=0$.

$$
\begin{align*}
x-9=0 && \text{or} && 3x+4=0\\
x=9 && && 3x=-4\\
&& && x=\frac{-4}{3}
\end{align*}
$$

Finding the Greatest Common Monomial Factor
-------------------------------------------

Once we get a polynomial in factored form, it is easier to solve the polynomial equation. But first, we need to learn how to factor. Factoring can take several steps because we want to factor completely so we cannot factor any more.

A **common factor** can be a number, a variable, or a combination of numbers and variables that appear in **every term** of the polynomial.

When a common factor is factored from a polynomial, you divide each term by the common factor. What is left over remains in parentheses.

**Example 3:** _Factor:_

1.  $15x-25$
2.  $3a+9b+6$

**Solution:**

1. We see that the factor of 5 divides evenly from all terms.

$$
15x-25=5(3x-5)
$$

2. We see that the factor of 3 divides evenly from all terms.

$$
3a+9b+6=3(a+3b+2)
$$

Now we will use examples where different powers can be factored and there is more than one common factor.

**Example 4:** _Find the greatest common factor._

(a) $a^3-3a^2+4a$

(b) $5x^3y-15x^2y^2+25xy^3$

**Solution:**

(a) Notice that the factor $a$ appears in all terms of $a^3-3a^2+4a$ but each term has a different power of $a$. The common factor is the lowest power that appears in the expression. In this case the factor is $a$.

Let’s rewrite $a^3-3a^2+4a=a(a^2)+a(-3a)+a(4)$

Factor $a$ to get $a(a^2-3a+4)$

(b) The common factors are $5xy$.

When we factor $5xy$, we obtain $5xy(x^2-3xy+5y^2)$.

Solving Simple Polynomial Equations by Factoring
------------------------------------------------

We already saw how we can use the Zero Product Property to solve polynomials in factored form. Here you will learn how to solve polynomials in expanded form. These are the steps for this process.

**Step 1: Rewrite** the equation in standard form such that: Polynomial expression $= 0$.

**Step 2: Factor** the polynomial completely.

**Step 3:** Use the zero-product rule to set **each factor equal to zero.**

**Step 4: Solve** each equation from step 3.

**Step 5: Check** your answers by substituting your solutions into the original equation.

**Example 5:** _Solve the following polynomial equation._

$$
x^2-2x=0
$$

**Solution:** $x^2-2x=0$

**Rewrite**: This is not necessary since the equation is in the correct form.

**Factor**: The common factor is $x$, so this factors as: $x(x-2)=0$.

**Set each factor equal to zero.**

$$
\begin{align*}
x=0 && \text{or} && x-2=0
\end{align*}
$$

**Solve**:

$$
\begin{align*}
x=0 && \text{or} && x=2
\end{align*}
$$

**Check**: Substitute each solution back into the original equation.

$$
\begin{align*}
x=0 && (0)^2-2(0)=0\\
x=2 && (2)^2-2(2)=0
\end{align*}
$$

**Answer** $x=0, \ x=2$

### 9.5 Factoring Quadratic Expressions

<article>

In this lesson, we will learn how to factor quadratic polynomials for different values of $a,\ b$, and $c$. In the last lesson, we factored common monomials, so you already know how to factor quadratic polynomials where $c=0$.

Factoring Quadratic Expressions in Standard From
------------------------------------------------

**Quadratic polynomials** are polynomials of degree 2. The standard form of a quadratic polynomial is $ax^2+bx+c$, _where_ $a,\ b$, _and_ $c$ _are real numbers_.

**Example 1:** _Factor_ $x^2+5x+6$.

**Solution:** We are looking for an answer that is a product of two binomials in parentheses: $(x+ \underline{\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;} \ )(x + \underline{\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;} \ )$.

To fill in the blanks, we want two numbers $m$ and $n$ that multiply to 6 and add to 5. A good strategy is to list the possible ways we can multiply two numbers to give us 6 and then see which of these pairs of numbers add to 5. The number six can be written as the product of.

$$
\begin{align*}
6&=1 \times 6 \qquad and \qquad 1+6=7\\
6&=2 \times 3 \qquad and \qquad 2+3=5
\end{align*}
$$

So the answer is $(x+2)(x+3)$.

We can check to see if this is correct by multiplying $(x+2)(x+3)$.

$x$ is multiplied by $x$ and $3 =x^2+3x$.

2 is multiplied by $x$ and $3 =2x+6$.

Combine the like terms: $x^2+5x+6$.

**Example 2:** _Factor_ $x^2-6x+8$.

**Solution:** We are looking for an answer that is a product of the two parentheses $(x+ \underline{\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;} \ )(x + \underline{\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;} \ )$.

The number 8 can be written as the product of the following numbers.

$8=1\cdot 8$ and $1+8=9$ Notice that these are two different choices.

$$
\begin{align*}
8&=(-1)(-8) && and && -1+(-8)=-9\\
8&=2 \times 4 && and && 2+4=6
\end{align*}
$$

**_And_**

$8=(-2)\cdot (-4)$ and $-2+(-4)=-6 \leftarrow$ This is the correct choice.

The answer is $(x-2)(x-4)$.

**Example 3:** _Factor_ $x^2+2x-15$.

**Solution:** We are looking for an answer that is a product of two parentheses $(x \pm \underline{\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;} \ )(x \pm \underline{\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;} \ )$.

In this case, we must take the negative sign into account. The number –15 can be written as the product of the following numbers.

$-15=-1 \cdot 15$ and $-1+15=14$ Notice that these are two different choices.

**And also,**

$-15=1 \cdot (-15)$ and $1+(-15)=-14$ Notice that these are two different choices.

$-15=(-3) \times 5$ _and_ $(-3)+5=2$ _This is the correct choice._

$-15=3 \times (-5)$ _and_ $3+(-5)=-2$

The answer is $(x-3)(x+5)$.

**Example 4:** _Factor_ $-x^2+x+6$.

**Solution:** First factor the common factor of –1 from each term in the trinomial. Factoring –1 changes the signs of each term in the expression.

$$
-x^2+x+6 = -(x^2-x-6)
$$

We are looking for an answer that is a product of two parentheses $(x \pm \underline{\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;} \ )(x \pm \underline{\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;} \ )$.

Now our job is to factor $x^2-x-6$.

The number –6 can be written as the product of the following numbers.

$$
\begin{align*}
&-6=(-1) \times 6 \qquad and \qquad (-1)+6=5\\
&-6=1 \times (-6) \qquad and \qquad 1+(-6)=-5\\
&-6=(-2) \times 3 \qquad and \qquad (-2)+3=1\\
&-6=2 \times (-3) \qquad and \qquad 2+(-3)=-1 \qquad This \ is \ the \ correct \ choice.
\end{align*}
$$

The answer is $-(x-3)(x+2)$.

**To Summarize:**

A quadratic of the form $x^2+bx+c$ factors as a product of two parenthesis $(x+m)(x+n)$.

* If $b$ and $c$ are positive then both $m$ and $n$ are positive.
    * Example $x^2+8x+12$ factors as $(x+6)(x+2)$.
* If $b$ is negative and $c$ is positive then both $m$ and $n$ are negative.
    * Example $x^2-6x+8$ factors as $(x-2)(x-4)$.
* If $c$ is negative then either $m$ is positive and $n$ is negative or vice-versa.
    * Example $x^2+2x-15$ factors as $(x+5)(x-3)$.
    * Example $x^2+34x-35$ factors as $(x+35)(x-1)$.
* If $a=-1$, factor a common factor of –1 from each term in the trinomial and then factor as usual. The answer will have the form $-(x+m)(x+n)$.
    * Example $-x^2+x+6$ factors as $-(x-3)(x+2)$.

### 9.6 Factoring Special Products

<article>

When we learned how to multiply binomials, we talked about two special products: the Sum and Difference Formula and the Square of a Binomial Formula. In this lesson, we will learn how to recognize and factor these special products.

Factoring the Difference of Two Squares
---------------------------------------

We use the Sum and Difference Formula to factor a difference of two squares. A difference of two squares can be a quadratic polynomial in this form: $a^2-b^2$. Both terms in the polynomial are perfect squares. In a case like this, the polynomial factors into the sum and difference of the square root of each term.

$$
a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)
$$

In these problems, the key is figuring out what the $a$ and $b$ terms are. Let’s do some examples of this type.

**Example 1:** _Factor the difference of squares._

(a) $x^2-9$

(b) $x^2y^2-1$

**Solution:**

(a) Rewrite as $x^2-9$ as $x^2-3^2$. Now it is obvious that it is a difference of squares.

We substitute the values of $a$ and $b$ for the Sum and Difference Formula:

$$
(x+3)(x-3)
$$

The answer is $x^2-9=(x+3)(x-3)$.

(b) Rewrite as $x^2y^2-1$ as $(xy)^2-1^2$. This factors as $(xy+1)(xy-1)$.

Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials
-----------------------------------

A **perfect square trinomial** has the form

$$
a^2+2ab+b^2 \qquad \text{or} \qquad a^2-2ab+b^2
$$

The **factored form** of a perfect square trinomial has the form

$$
\begin{align*}
&&(a+b)^2 \ if \ a^2+2(ab)+b^2\\
\text{And}\\
&&(a-b)^2 \ if \ a^2-2(ab)+b^2
\end{align*}
$$

In these problems, the key is figuring out what the $a$ and $b$ terms are. Let’s do some examples of this type.

Example: $x^2+8x+16$

Solution: Check that the first term and the last term are perfect squares.

$$
x^2+8x+16 \qquad \text{as} \qquad x^2+8x+4^2.
$$

Check that the middle term is twice the product of the square roots of the first and the last terms. This is true also since we can rewrite them.

$$
x^2+8x+16 \qquad \text{as} \qquad x^2+2 \cdot 4 \cdot x+4^2
$$

This means we can factor $x^2+8x+16$ as $(x+4)^2$.

**Example 2:** _Factor_ $x^2-4x+4$.

**Solution:** Rewrite $x^2-4x+4$ as $x^2+2 \cdot (-2) \cdot x+(-2)^2$.

We notice that this is a perfect square trinomial and we can factor it as: $(x-2)^2$.

Solving Polynomial Equations Involving Special Products
-------------------------------------------------------

We have learned how to factor quadratic polynomials that are helpful in solving polynomial equations like $ax^2+bx+c=0$. Remember that to solve polynomials in expanded form, we use the following steps:

**Step 1: Rewrite** the equation in standard form such that: Polynomial expression = 0.

**Step 2: Factor** the polynomial completely.

**Step 3:** Use the Zero Product Property to set **each factor equal to zero.**

**Step 4: Solve** each equation from step 3.

**Step 5: Check** your answers by substituting your solutions into the original equation.

**Example 3:** _Solve the following polynomial equations._

$$
x^2+7x+6=0
$$

**Solution:** No need to rewrite because it is already in the correct form.

**Factor:** We write 6 as a product of the following numbers:

$$
\begin{align*}
6& =6 \times 1 && \text{and} && 6+1=7\\
x^2+7x+6 & = 0 && \text{factors as} && (x+1)(x+6)=0
\end{align*}
$$

**Set each factor equal to zero:**

$$
x+1=0 \qquad \text{or} \qquad x+6=0
$$

**Solve:**

$$
x=-1 \qquad \text{or} \qquad x=-6
$$

**Check:** Substitute each solution back into the original equation.

$$
\begin{align*}
(-1)^2+7(-1)+6&=1+(-7)+6=0\\
(-6)^2+7(-6)+6&=36+(-42)+6=0
\end{align*}
$$

### 9.7 Factoring Polynomials Completely

<article>

We say that a polynomial is **factored completely** when we factor as much as we can and we are unable to factor any more. Here are some suggestions that you should follow to make sure that you factor completely.

$\checkmark$ Factor all common monomials first.

$\checkmark$ Identify special products such as difference of squares or the square of a binomial. Factor according to their formulas.

$\checkmark$ If there are no special products, factor using the methods we learned in the previous sections.

$\checkmark$ Look at each factor and see if any of these can be factored further.

**Example 1:** _Factor the following polynomials completely._

(a) $2x^2-8$

(b) $x^3+6x^2+9x$

**Solution:**

(a) Look for the common monomial factor. $2x^2-8=2(x^2-4)$. Recognize $x^2-4$ as a difference of squares. We factor $2(x^2-4)=2(x+2)(x-2)$. If we look at each factor we see that we can't factor anything else. The answer is $2(x+2)(x-2)$.

(b) Recognize this as a perfect square and factor as $x(x+3)^2$. If we look at each factor we see that we can't factor anything else. The answer is $x(x+3)^2$.

Factoring Common Binomials
--------------------------

The first step in the factoring process is often factoring the common monomials from a polynomial. Sometimes polynomials have common terms that are binomials. For example, consider the following expression.

$$
x(3x+2)-5(3x+2)
$$

You can see that the term $(3x+2)$ appears in both terms of the polynomial. This common term can be factored by writing it in front of a set of parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we write all the terms that are left over when we divide them by the common factor.

$$
(3x+2)(x-5)
$$

This expression is now completely factored. Let’s look at some examples.

**Example 2:** _Factor_ $3x(x-1)+4(x-1)$.

**Solution:** $3x(x-1)+4(x-1)$ has a common binomial of $(x-1)$.

When we factor the common binomial, we get $(x-1)(3x+4)$.

Factoring by Grouping
---------------------

It may be possible to factor a polynomial containing four or more terms by factoring common monomials from groups of terms. This method is called **factoring by grouping**. The following example illustrates how this process works.

**Example 3:** _Factor_ $2x+2y+ax+ay$.

**Solution:** There isn't a common factor for all four terms in this example. However, there is a factor of 2 that is common to the first two terms and there is a factor of $a$ that is common to the last two terms. Factor 2 from the first two terms and factor $a$ from the last two terms.

$$
2x+2y+ax+ay = 2(x+y) +a(x+y)
$$

Now we notice that the binomial $(x+y)$ is common to both terms. We factor the common binomial and get.

$$
(x+y)(2+a)
$$

Our polynomial is now factored completely.

We know how to factor Quadratic Trinomials $(ax^2+bx+c)$ where $a \neq 1$ using methods we have previously learned. To factor a quadratic polynomial where $a \neq 1$, we follow the following steps.

1.  We find the product $ac$.
2.  We look for two numbers that multiply to give $ac$ and add to give $b$.
3.  We rewrite the middle term using the two numbers we just found.
4.  We factor the expression by grouping.

Let’s apply this method to the following examples.

**Example 4:** _Factor_ $3x^2+8x+4$ _by grouping_.

**Solution:** Follow the steps outlined above.

$$
ac=3 \cdot 4=12
$$

The number 12 can be written as a product of two numbers in any of these ways:

$$
\begin{align*}
12&=1 \times 12 && and && 1+12=13\\
12 & =2 \times 6 && and && 2+6=8 \qquad \text{This is the correct choice}.
\end{align*}
$$

Rewrite the middle term as: $8x=2x+6x$, so the problem becomes the following.

$$
3x^2+8x+4 = 3x^2+2x+6x+4
$$

Factor an $x$ from the first two terms and 2 from the last two terms.

$$
x(3x+2)+2(3x+2)
$$

Now factor the common binomial $(3x+2)$.

$$
(3x+2)(x+2)
$$

Our answer is $(3x+2)(x+2)$.

In this example, all the coefficients are positive. What happens if the $b$ is negative?

**Example 5:** _Factor_ $6x^2-11x+4$ _by grouping_.

**Solution:** $ac=6 \cdot 4 = 24$

The number 24 can be written as a product of two numbers in any of these ways.

$$
\begin{align*}
24&=1\times 24 && and && 1+24=25\\
24&=(-1) \times (-24) && and && (-1)+(-24)=-25\\
24&=2 \times 12 && and && 2+12=14\\
24&=(-2) \times (-12) && and && (-2)+(-12)=-14\\
24&=3 \times 8 && and && 3+8=11\\
24&=(-3) \times (-8) && and && (-3)+(-8)=-11 \quad \text{This is the correct choice}.
\end{align*}
$$

Rewrite the middle term as $-11x=-3x-8x$, so the problem becomes:

$$
6x^2-11x+4=6x^2-3x-8x+4
$$

Factor by grouping. Factor a $3x$ from the first two terms and factor –4 from the last two terms.

$$
3x(2x-1)-4(2x-1)
$$

Now factor the common binomial $(2x-1)$.

Our answer is $(2x-1)(3x-4)$.

Solving Real-World Problems Using Polynomial Equations
------------------------------------------------------

Now that we know most of the factoring strategies for quadratic polynomials, we can see how these methods apply to solving real-world problems.

**Example 6:** _The product of two positive numbers is 60. Find the two numbers if one of the numbers is 4 more than the other._

**Solution:** $x=$ one of the numbers and $x+4$ equals the other number. The product of these two numbers equals 60. We can write the equation.

$$
x(x+4)=60
$$

Write the polynomial in standard form.

$$
\begin{align*}
x^2+4x&=60\\
x^2+4x-60&=0
\end{align*}
$$

**Factor:** $-60=6 \times(-10)$ _and_ $6+(-10)=-4$

$-60=-6 \times 10$ _and_ $-6+10=4$ This is the correct choice.

The expression factors as $(x+10)(x-6)=0$.

**Solve:**

$$
\begin{align*}
x+10=0 && x-6& =0\\
\text{or} \\
x=-10 && x& =6
\end{align*}
$$

Since we are looking for positive numbers, the answer must be positive.

$x=6$ for one number, and $x+4=10$ for the other number.

**Check:** $6 \cdot 10=60$ so the answer checks.

### 9.8 Probability of Compound Events

<article>

We begin this lesson with a reminder of probability.

The **experimental probability** is the ratio of the proposed outcome to the number of experiment trials.

$$
P(success)= \frac{number \ of \ times \ the \ event \ occured}{total \ number \ of \ trials \ of \ experiment}
$$

Probability can be expressed as a percentage, a fraction, a decimal, or a ratio.

This lesson will focus on **compound events** and the formulas used to determine the probability of such events.

**Compound events** are two simple events taken together, usually expressed as $A$ and $B$.

Independent and Dependent Events
--------------------------------

Example: Suppose you flip a coin and roll a die at the same time. What is the probability you will flip a head **_and_** roll a four?

These events are **independent**. Independent events occur when the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of the second event. Rolling a four has no effect on tossing a head.

To find the probability of two **independent events**, multiply the probability of the first event by the probability of the second event.

$$
P(A \ and \ B)=P(A) \cdot P(B)
$$

Solution:

$$
\begin{align*}
P(tossing \ a \ head)&=\frac{1}{2}\\
P(rolling \ a \ 4)&=\frac{1}{6}\\
P(tossing \ a \ head \ AND \ rolling \ a \ 4)&=\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{12}
\end{align*}
$$

When events depend upon each other, they are called **dependent events**. Suppose you randomly draw a card from a standard deck then randomly draw a second card **without replacing the first**. The second probability is now different from the first.

To find the probability of two **dependent events**, multiply the probability of the first event by the probability of the second event, _after the first event occurs_.

$$
P(A \ and \ B)=P(A) \cdot P(B \ following \ A)
$$

Example: Two cards are chosen from a deck of cards. What is the probability that they both will be face cards?

Solution: Let $A = 1st \ Face \ card \ chosen$ and $B = 2nd \ Face \ card \ chosen$. The total number of face cards in the deck is $4 \times 3 = 12$.

$$
\begin{align*}
P(A)&= \frac{12}{52}\\
P(B) & = \frac{11}{51}, \ \text{remember, one card has been removed.}
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
P(A \ AND \ B)= \frac{12}{52} \times \frac{11}{51} \ & or \ P(A \cap B) = \frac{12}{52} \times \frac{11}{51} =\frac{33}{663}\\
P(A \cap B) & = \frac{11}{221}
\end{align*}
$$

Mutually Exclusive Events
-------------------------

Events that **cannot happen at the same time** are called **mutually exclusive** events. For example, a number cannot be both even and odd or you cannot have picked a single card from a deck of cards that is both a ten and a jack. **Mutually inclusive** events, however, can occur at the same time. For example a number can be both less than 5 and even or you can pick a card from a deck of cards that can be a club and a ten.

When finding the probability of events occurring at the same time, there is a concept known as the “double counting” feature. It happens when the intersection is counted twice.

![0](media/322.png "Figure 1: In mutually exclusive events, $P(A \cap B)=\phi$, because they cannot happen at the same time.")

To find the probability of either mutually exclusive events $A$ or $B$ occurring, use the following formula.

To find the probability of one or the other mutually exclusive or inclusive events, add the individual probabilities and subtract the probability they occur at the same time.

$$
P(A \ or \ B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)
$$

Example: Two cards are drawn from a deck of cards. Let:

$A$: $1^{st}$ card is a club

$B$: $1^{st}$ card is a 7

$C$: $2^{nd}$ card is a heart

Find the following probabilities:

(a) $P(A \ \text{or} \  B)$

(b) $P(B \ \text{or} \ A)$

(c) $P(A \ \text{and} \ C)$

Solution:

(a) 

$$
P(A \ or \ B)=\frac{13}{52}+\frac{4}{52}-\frac{1}{52}\!\\
P(A \ or \ B) =\frac{16}{52}\!\\
P(A \ or \ B) =\frac{4}{13}
$$

(b)

## 10.0 Quadratic Equations and Functions

<article>

As you saw in Chapter 8, algebraic functions not only produce straight lines but curved ones too. A special type of curved function is called a parabola. Perhaps you have seen the shape of a parabola before:

* The shape of the water from a drinking fountain
* The path a football takes when thrown
* The shape of an exploding firework
* The shape of a satellite dish
* The path a diver takes into the water
* The shape of a mirror in a car’s headlamp

Many real life situations model a quadratic equation. This chapter will explore the graph of a quadratic equation and how to solve such equations using various methods.

### 10.1 Graphs of Quadratic Functions

<article>

Chapter 9 introduced the concept of factoring quadratic trinomials of the form $0=ax^2+bx+c$. This is also called the **standard form for a quadratic equation.** The most basic quadratic equation is $y=x^2$. The word quadratic comes from the Latin word _quadrare,_ meaning “to square.” By creating a table of values and graphing the ordered pairs, you find that a quadratic equation makes a $U$\-shaped figure called a **parabola.**

| $x$ | $y$ |
| --- | --- |
| –2  | 4   |
| –1  | 1   |
| 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   |
| 2   | 4   |

![0](media/324.png "Figure 1: The Anatomy of a Parabola")
-------------------------

A parabola can be divided in half by a vertical line. Because of this, parabolas have **symmetry.** The vertical line dividing the parabola into two equal portions is called the **line of symmetry.** All parabolas have a **vertex,** the ordered pair that represents the bottom (or the top) of the curve.

The vertex of a parabola has an ordered pair $(h, k)$.

![0](media/325.png "Figure 2: Because the line of symmetry is a vertical line, its equation has the form $y=h$, where $h=$ _the_ $x-$_coordinate of the vertex._")

An equation of the form $y=ax^2$ forms a parabola.

If $a$ is positive, the parabola will open **upward.** The vertex will be a **minimum.**

If $a$ is negative, the parabola will open **downward.** The vertex will be a **maximum.**

The variable $a$ in the equation above is called the **leading coefficient** of the quadratic equation. Not only will it tell you if the parabola opens up or down, but it will also tell you the width.

If $a>1$ or $a<-1$, the parabola will be **narrow** about the line of symmetry.

If $-1 < a < 1$, the parabola will be **wide** about the line of symmetry.

**Example 1:** _Determine the direction and shape of the parabola formed by_ $y=-\frac{1}{2} x^2$.

**Solution:** The value of $a$ in the quadratic equation is –1.

* Because $a$ is negative, the parabola opens downward.
* Because $a$ is between –1 and 1, the parabola is wide about its line of symmetry.

Domain and Range
----------------

Several times throughout this textbook, you have experienced the terms **domain** and **range.** Remember:

* Domain is the set of all inputs ($x-$coordinates).
* Range is the set of all outputs ($y-$coordinates).

The domain of every quadratic equation is all real numbers $(\mathbb{R})$. The range of a parabola depends upon whether the parabola opens up or down.

If $a$ is positive, the range will be $y \ge k$.

If $a$ is negative, the range will be $y \le k$, where $k=y-$_coordinate of the vertex._

Vertical Shifts
---------------

Compare the five parabolas to the right. What do you notice?

![0](media/326.png "Figure 3: The five different parabolas are congruent with different $y-$intercepts. Each parabola has an equation of the form $y=ax^2+c$, where $a=1$ and $c=y-$_intercept._ In general, the value of $c$ will tell you where the parabola will intersect the $y-$axis.")

The equation $y=ax^2+c$ is a parabola with a $y-$intercept of $(0, c)$.

The vertical movement along a parabola’s line of symmetry is called a **vertical shift.**

**Example 1:** _Determine the direction, shape, and $y-$intercept of the parabola formed by_ $y=\frac{3}{2} x^2-4$.

**Solution:** The value of $a$ in the quadratic equation is $\frac{3}{2}$.

* Because $a$ is positive, the parabola opens upward.
* Because $a$ is greater than 1, the parabola is narrow about its line of symmetry.
* The value of $c$ is –4, so the $y-$intercept is (0, –4).

Projectiles are often described by quadratic equations. When an object is dropped from a tall building or cliff, it does not travel at a constant speed. The longer it travels, the faster it goes. Galileo described this relationship between distance fallen and time. It is known as his kinematical law. It states the “distance traveled varies directly with the square of time.” As an algebraic equation, this law is:

$$
d=16t^2
$$

Use this information to graph the distance an object travels during the first six seconds.

| $t$ | $d$ |
| --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 16  |
| 2   | 64  |
| 3   | 144 |
| 4   | 256 |
| 5   | 400 |
| 6   | 576 |

![0](media/327.png "Figure 4: The parabola opens upward and its vertex is located at the origin. The value of $a>1$, so the graph is narrow about its line of symmetry. However, because the values of the dependent variable $d$ are very large, the graph is misleading.")

**Example 2:** _Anne is playing golf. On the fourth tee, she hits a slow shot down the level fairway. The ball follows a parabolic path described by the equation,_ $y=x-0.04x^2$, _where_ $x=$ _distance in feet from the tee and_ $y=$ _height of the golf ball, in feet._

_Describe the shape of this parabola. What is its $y-$intercept?_

**Solution:** The value of $a$ in the quadratic equation is –0.04.

* Because $a$ is negative, the parabola opens downward.
* Because $a$ is between –1 and 1, the parabola is wide about its line of symmetry.
* The value of $c$ is 0, so the $y-$intercept is (0, 0).

The distance it takes a car to stop (in feet) given its speed (in miles per hour) is given by the function $d(s)=\frac{1}{20} \ s^2+s$. This equation is in standard form $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$, where $a=\frac{1}{20}, b=1$, and $c=0$.

Graph the function by making a table of speed values.

![0](media/328.png "Figure 5: | $s$ | $d$ |")
| --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   |
| 10  | 15  |
| 20  | 40  |
| 30  | 75  |
| 40  | 120 |
| 50  | 175 |
| 60  | 240 |

* The parabola opens upward with a vertex at (0, 0).
* The line of symmetry is $x=0$.
* The parabola is wide about its line of symmetry.

Using the function to find the stopping distance of a car travelling 65 miles per hour yields:

$$
d(65)=\frac{1}{20} (65)^2+65=276.25 \ feet
$$

### 10.2 Solving Quadratic Equations by Graphing

<article>

Isaac Newton’s theory for projectile motion is represented by the equation:

$$
h(t)=- \frac{1}{2} (g) t^2+v_0 t+h_0
$$

* $t=$_time_ (_usually in seconds_)
* $g=$_gravity due to acceleration; either_ $9.8 m/s^2$ _or_ $32 ft/s^2$
* $v_0=$_initial velocity_
* $h_0=$_initial height of object_

Consider the following situation: “A quarterback throws a football at an initial height of 5.5 feet with an initial velocity of 35 feet per second.”

By substituting the appropriate information:

* $g=32$ because the information is given in feet
* $v_0=35$
* $h_0=5.5$

The equation becomes $h(t)=-\frac{1}{2} (32) t^2+35t+5.5 \rightarrow h(t)=-16t^2+35t+5.5$.

Using the concepts from the previous lesson, we know

* The value of $a$ is negative, so the parabola opens downward.
* The vertex is a maximum point.
* The $y-$intercept is (0, 5.5).
* The graph is narrow about its line of symmetry.

At what time will the football be 6 feet high? This equation can be solved by graphing the quadratic equation.

Solving a Quadratic Using a Calculator
--------------------------------------

Chapter 7 focused on how to solve systems by graphing. You can think of this situation as a system: 

$$
\begin{cases} 
  y=-16t^2+35t+5.5\\
  y=6 
\end{cases}
$$

. You are looking for the appropriate $x-$coordinates that give a $y-$coordinate of 6 feet. Therefore, you are looking for the **intersection** of the two equations.

Begin by typing the equations into the $[Y=]$ menu of your calculator. Adjust the window until you see the vertex, $y-$intercept, $x-$intercepts, and the horizontal line of 6 units.

![0](media/332.png "Figure 1: ![0](media/333.png)")

\[Figure 2\]

![0](media/334.png "Figure 3: By looking at the graph, you can see there are **two** points of intersection. Using the methods from chapter 7, find both points of intersection.")

$$
(0.014,6) \ and \ (2.172,6)
$$

At 0.014 seconds and again at 2.17 seconds, the football is six feet from the ground.

Using a Calculator to Find the Vertex
-------------------------------------

You can also use a graphing calculator to determine the **vertex** of the parabola. The vertex of this equation is a maximum point, so in the **\[CALCULATE\]** menu of the graphing option, look for **\[MAXIMUM\]**.

![0](media/335.png "Figure 4: Choose option #4. The calculator will ask you, “LEFT BOUND?” Move the cursor to the left of the vertex and hit **\[ENTER\].**")

The calculator will ask, “RIGHT BOUND?” Move the cursor to the right of the vertex and hit **\[ENTER\].**

Hit **\[ENTER\]** to guess.

The maximum point on this parabola is (1.09, 24.64).

**Example 1:** _Will the football reach 25 feet high?_

**Solution:** The vertex represents the maximum point of this quadratic equation. Since its height is 24.64 feet, we can safely say the football will **not** reach 25 feet.

**Example 2:** _When will the football hit the ground, assuming no one will catch it?_

**Solution:** We know want to know at what time the height is zero. 

$$
\begin{cases} 
  y=-16t^2+35t+5.5 \\
  y=0 
\end{cases}
$$

. By repeating the process above and finding the intersection of the two lines, the solution is (2.33, 0). At 2.33 seconds, the ball will hit the ground.

The point at which the ball reaches the ground $(y=0)$ represents the $x-$**intercept** of the graph.

The $x-$intercept of a quadratic equation is also called a **root, solution,** or **zero.**

Example: _Determine the number of solutions to_ $y=x^2+4$.

Solution: Graph this quadratic equation, either by hand or with a graphing calculator. Adjust the calculator’s window to see both halves of the parabola, the vertex, the $x-$axis, and the $y-$intercept.

The solutions to a quadratic equation are also known as its $x-$**intercepts.** This parabola does not cross the $x-$axis. Therefore, this quadratic equation has **no real solutions.**

![0](media/336.png "Figure 5: Example: _Andrew has 100 feet of fence to enclose a rectangular tomato patch. He wants to find the dimensions of the rectangle that encloses the most area._")

Solution: The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all four sides. Let $w=$ _width_ and $l=$ _length._ The perimeter of the tomato patch is $100=l+l+w+w \rightarrow 100=2l+2w$.

The area of a rectangle is found by the formula $A=l(w)$. We are looking for the intersection between the area and perimeter of the rectangular tomato patch. This is a system.

$$
\begin{cases} 
 100 = 2l+2w \\
 A = l(w) 
\end{cases}
$$

Before we can graph this system, we need to rewrite the first equation for either $l$ or $w$. We will then use the Substitution Property.

$$
\begin{align*}
100 &= 2l+2w \rightarrow 100-2l=2w\\
\frac{100-2l}{2} &= w \rightarrow 50-l=w
\end{align*}
$$

Use the Substitution Property to replace the variable $w$ in the second equation with the express $50-l$.

$$
A=l(50-l)=50l-l^2
$$

Graph this equation to visualize it.

![0](media/337.png "Figure 6: ![0](media/338.png)")

\[Figure 7\]

The parabola opens downward so the vertex is a maximum. The maximum value is (25, 625). The length of the tomato patch should be 25 feet long to achieve a maximum area of 625 square feet.

### 10.3 Solving Quadratic Equations Using Square Roots

<article>

Suppose you needed to find the value of $x$ such that $x^2=81$. How could you solve this equation?

* Make a table of values.
* Graph this equation as a system.
* Cancel the square using its inverse operation.

The inverse of a square is a square root.

By applying the square root to each side of the equation, you get:

$$
\begin{align*}
x &= \pm \sqrt{81}\\
x &= 9 \ or \ x=-9
\end{align*}
$$

In general, the solution to a quadratic equation of the form $0=ax^2-c$ is:

$$
x=\sqrt{\frac{c}{a}} \ \text{or} \ x=- \sqrt{\frac{c}{a}}
$$

**Example 1:** _Solve_ $(x-4)^2-9=0$.

**Solution:** Begin by adding 9 to each side of the equation.

$$
(x-4)^2=9
$$

Cancel square by applying square root.

$$
x-4=3 \ or \ x-4=-3
$$

Solve both equations for $x: x=7 \ or \ x=1$

In the previous lesson, you learned Newton’s formula for projectile motion. Let’s examine a situation in which there is no initial velocity. When a ball is dropped, there is no outward force placed on its path; therefore, there is no initial velocity.

A ball is dropped from a 40-foot building. When does the ball reach the ground?

Using the equation from the previous lesson, $h(t)=-\frac{1}{2} (g) t^2+v_0 t+h_0$, and substituting the appropriate information, you get:

$$
\begin{align*}
&& 0 &=-\frac{1}{2} (32)t^2+(0)t+40\\
\text{Simplify} && 0 &= -16t^2+40\\
\text{Solve for} \ x: && -40 &= -16t^2\\
&& 2.5 &= t^2\\
&& t & \approx 1.58 \ and \ t \approx -1.58
\end{align*}
$$

Because $t$ is in seconds, it does not make much sense for the answer to be negative. So the ball will reach the ground at approximately 1.58 seconds.

Example: _A rock is dropped from the top of a cliff and strikes the ground 7.2 seconds later. How high is the cliff in meters?_

Solution: Using Newton’s formula, substitute the appropriate information.

$$
\begin{align*}
&& 0 &= -\frac{1}{2} (9.8)(7.2)^2+(0)(7.2)+ h_0\\
\text{Simplify:} && 0 &= -254.016+h_0\\
\text{Solve for} \ h_0: && h_0 &= 254.016
\end{align*}
$$

The cliff is approximately 254 meters tall.

### 10.4 Solving Quadratic Equations by Completing the Square

<article>

There are several ways to write an equation for a parabola:

* Standard form: $y=ax^2+bx+c$
* Factored form: $y=(x+m)(x+n)$
* **Vertex form:** $y=a(x-h)^2+k$

Vertex form of a quadratic equation: $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $(h,k)=$ _vertex of the parabola_ and $a=$ _leading coefficient_

**Example 1:** _Determine the vertex of_ $y=-\frac{1}{2} (x-4)^2-7$. _Is this a minimum or a maximum point of the parabola?_

**Solution:** Using the definition of vertex form, $h=4, k=-7$.

* The vertex is (4, –7).
* Because $a$ is negative, the parabola opens downward.
* Therefore, the vertex (4, –7) is a maximum point of the parabola.

Once you know the vertex, you can use symmetry to graph the parabola.

| $x$ | $y$ |
| --- | --- |
| 2   |     |
| 3   |     |
| 4   | –7  |
| 5   |     |
| 6   |     |

**Example 2:** _Write the equation for a parabola with_ $a=3$ _and vertex (–4, 5) in vertex form._

**Solution:** Using the definition of vertex form $y=a(x-h)^2+k, h=-4$ and $k=5$.

$$
\begin{align*}
y &= 3(x-(-4))^2+5\\
y &= 3(x+4)^2+5
\end{align*}
$$

Consider the quadratic equation $y=x^2+4x-2$. What is its vertex? You could graph this using your calculator and determine the vertex or you could **complete the square.**

Completing the Square
---------------------

Completing the square is a method used to create a **perfect square trinomial,** as you learned in the previous chapter.

A **perfect square trinomial** has the form $a^2+2(ab)+b^2$, which factors into $(a+b)^2$.

Example: Find the missing value to create a perfect square trinomial: $x^2+8x+?$.

Solution: The value of $a$ is $x$. To find $b$, use the definition of the middle term of the perfect square trinomial.

$$
\begin{align*}
&& 2(ab) &= 8x\\
a \ \text{is} \ x, && 2(xb) &= 8x\\
\text{Solve for} \ b: && \frac{2xb}{2x} &= \frac{8x}{2x} \rightarrow b=4
\end{align*}
$$

To complete the square you need the value of $b^2$.

$$
b^2=4^2=16
$$

The missing value is 16.

To complete the square, the equation must be in the form: $y=x^2+\left(\frac{1}{2} b \right )x+b^2$.

Looking at the above example, $\frac{1}{2}(8)=4$ and $4^2=16$.

**Example 3:** _Find the missing value to complete the square of_ $x^2+22x+$?. _Then factor._

**Solution:** Use the definition of the middle term to complete the square.

$$
\frac{1}{2} (b)=\frac{1}{2} (22)=11
$$

Therefore, $11^2=121$ and the perfect square trinomial is $x^2+22x+121$. Rewriting in its factored form, the equation becomes $(x+11)^2$.

Solve Using Completing the Square
---------------------------------

Once you have the equation written in vertex form, you can solve using the method learned in the last lesson.

Example: Solve $x^2+22x+121=0$.

Solution: By completing the square and factoring, the equation becomes:

$$
\begin{align*}
&& (x+11)^2 &= 0\\
\text{Solve by taking the square root:} && x+11 &= \pm0\\
\text{Separate into two equations:} && x+11 &=0 \ or \ x+11=0\\
\text{Solve for} \ x: && x &= -11
\end{align*}
$$

Example: Solve $x^2+10x+9=0$.

Solution: Using the definition to complete the square, $\frac{1}{2}(b)=\frac{1}{2}(10)=5$. Therefore, the last value of the perfect square trinomial is $5^2=25$. The equation given is

$$
x^2+10x+9=0, \ and \ 9 \neq 25
$$

Therefore, to complete the square, we must rewrite the standard form of this equation into vertex form.

Subtract 9: 

$$
x^2+10x=-9
$$

Complete the square: Remember to use the Addition Property of Equality.

$$
\begin{align*}
&& x^2+10x+25 &= -9+25\\
\text{Factor the left side.} && (x+5)^2 &= 16\\
\text{Solve using square roots.} && \sqrt{(x+5)^2} &= \pm \sqrt{16}\\
&& x+5 &=4 \ or \ x+5=-4\\
&& x &= -1 \ or \ x=-9
\end{align*}
$$

Example: _An arrow is shot straight up from a height of 2 meters with a velocity of 50 m/s_. What is the maximum height that the arrow will reach and at what time will that happen?

Solution: The maximum height is the vertex of the parabola. Therefore, we need to rewrite the equation in vertex form.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{We rewrite the equation in vertext form.} && y &= -4.9t^2+50t+2\\
&& y-2 &= -4.9t^2+50t\\
&& y-2 &= -4.9(t^2-10.2t)\\
\text{Complete the square inside the parentheses.} && y-2-4.9(5.1)^2 &= -4.9(t^2-10.2t+(5.1)^2)\\
&& y-129.45 &= -4.9(t-5.1)^2
\end{align*}
$$

The maximum height is 129.45 meters.

### 10.5 Solving Quadratic Equations Using the Quadratic Formula

<article>

This chapter has presented three methods to solve a quadratic equation:

* By graphing to find the zeros;
* By solving using square roots; and
* By using completing the square to find the solutions

This lesson will present a fourth way to solve a quadratic equation: using the Quadratic Formula.

History of the Quadratic Formula
--------------------------------

As early as 1200 BC, people were interested in solving quadratic equations. The Babylonians solved simultaneous equations involving quadratics. In 628 AD, Brahmagupta, an Indian mathematician, gave the first explicit formula to solve a quadratic equation. The Quadratic Formula was written as it is today by the Arabic mathematician Al-Khwarizmi. It is his name upon which the word “Algebra” is based.

The solution to any quadratic equation in standard form $0=ax^2+bx+c$ is

$$
x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

Example: Solve $x^2+10x+9=0$ using the Quadratic Formula.

Solution: We know from the last lesson the answers are $x=-1$ _or_ $x=-9$.

By applying the Quadratic Formula and $a=1, b=10$, and $c=9$, we get:

$$
\begin{align*}
x &= \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{(10)^2-4(1)(9)}}{2(1)}\\
x &= \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{100-36}}{2}\\
x &= \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{64}}{2}\\
x &= \frac{-10 \pm 8}{2}\\
x &= \frac{-10 + 8}{2} \ or \ x=\frac{-10-8}{2}\\
x &= -1 \ or \ x=-9
\end{align*}
$$

**Example 1:** _Solve_ $-4x^2+x+1=0$ _using the Quadratic Formula._

**Solution:**

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Quadratic formula:} && x & =\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\
\text{Plug in the values} \ a=-4, b=1, c=1. &&  x& =\frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{(1)^2-4(-4)(1)}}{2(-4)}\\
\text{Simplify.} &&  x & =\frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1+16}}{-8}=\frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{17}}{-8}\\
\text{Separate the two options.} && x&=\frac{-1+\sqrt{17}}{-8} \ \text{and} \ x=\frac{-1-\sqrt{17}}{-8}\\
\text{Solve.} && x & \approx -.39 \ \text{and} \ x \approx .64
\end{align*}
$$

**Multimedia Link** For more examples of solving quadratic equations using the Quadratic Formula, see [Khan Academy Equation Part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19jYxzY8Y8) (9:14).

**Figure** 2 provides more examples of solving equations using the quadratic equation. This video is not necessarily different from the examples above, but it does help reinforce the procedure of using the Quadratic Formula to solve equations.

Finding the Vertex of a Quadratic Equation in Standard Form
-----------------------------------------------------------

The $x-$coordinate of the vertex of $0=ax^2+bx+c$ is $x=-\frac{b}{a}$

Which Method to Use?
--------------------

Usually you will not be told which method to use. You will have to make that decision yourself. However, here are some guidelines to which methods are better in different situations.

* **Graphing** – a good method to visualize the parabola and easily see the intersections. Not always precise.
* **Factoring** – best if the quadratic expression is easily factorable
* **Taking the square root** – is best used of the form $0=ax^2-c$
* **Completing the square** – can be used to solve any quadratic equation. It is a very important method for rewriting a quadratic function in vertex form.
* **Quadratic Formula** – is the method that is used most often for solving a quadratic equation. If you are using factoring or the Quadratic Formula, make sure that the equation is in standard form.

Example: _The length of a rectangular pool is 10 meters more than its width. The area of the pool is 875 square meters. Find the dimensions of the pool._

Solution: Begin by drawing a sketch. The formula for the area of a rectangle is $A=l(w)$.

![0](media/341.png "Figure 1: $$")
\begin{align*}
A &= (x+10)(x)\\
875 &= x^2+10x
\end{align*}
$$

Now solve for $x$ using any method you prefer.

The result is $x=25$. So, the length of the pool is 35 meters and the width is 25 meters.

### 10.6 The Discriminant

<article>

You have seen parabolas that intersect the $x-$axis twice, once, or not at all. There is a relationship between the number of real $x-$intercepts and the Quadratic Formula.

**_Case 1:_** The parabola has two $x-$intercepts. This situation has two possible solutions for $x$, because the value inside the square root is positive. Using the Quadratic Formula, the solutions are $x=\frac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ and $x=\frac{-b-\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.

![0](media/344.png "Figure 1: **_Case 2:_** The parabola has one $x-$intercept. This situation occurs when the vertex of the parabola just touches the $x-$axis. This is called a repeated root, or **double root.** The value inside the square root is zero. Using the Quadratic Formula, the solution is $x=\frac{-b}{2a}$.")

![0](media/345.png "Figure 2: **_Case 3:_** The parabola has no $x-$intercept. This situation occurs when the parabola does not cross the $x-$axis. The value inside the square root is negative, therefore there are no real roots. The solutions to this type of situation are **imaginary,** which you will learn more about in a later textbook.")

![0](media/346.png "Figure 3: The value inside the square root of the Quadratic Formula is called the **discriminant.** It is symbolized by $D$. It dictates the number of real solutions the quadratic equation has. This can be summarized with the Discriminant Theorem.")

* If $D>0$, the parabola will have two $x-$intercepts. The quadratic equation will have two real solutions.
* If $D=0$, the parabola will have one $x-$intercept. The quadratic equation will have one real solution.
* If $D<0$, the parabola will have no $x-$intercepts. The quadratic equation will have zero real solutions.

**Example 1:** _Determine the number of real solutions to_ $-3x^2+4x+1=0$.

**Solution:** By finding the value of its discriminant, you can determine the number of $x-$intercepts the parabola has and thus the number of real solutions.

$$
\begin{align*}
D &= b^2-4(a)(c)\\
D &= (4)^2-4(-3)(1)\\
D &= 16+12=28
\end{align*}
$$

Because the discriminant is positive, the parabola has two real $x-$intercepts and thus two real solutions.

Example: _Determine the number of solutions to_ $-2x^2+x=4$.

Solution: Before we can find its discriminant, we must write the equation in standard form $ax^2+bx+c=0$.

Subtract 4 from each side of the equation: $-2x^2+x-4=0$.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Find the discriminant.} && D &= (1)^2-4(-2)(-4)\\
&& D &= 1-32=-31
\end{align*}
$$

The value of the discriminant is negative; there are no real solutions to this quadratic equation. The parabola does not cross the $x-$axis.

**Example 2:** _Emma and Bradon own a factory that produces bike helmets. Their accountant says that their profit per year is given by the function $P=0.003x^2+12x+27,760$, where $x$ represents the number of helmets produced. Their goal is to make a profit of $40,000 this year. Is this possible?_

**Solution:** The equation we are using is $40,000=0.003x^2+12x+27,760$. By finding the value of its discriminant, you can determine if the profit is possible.

Begin by writing this equation in standard form:

$$
\begin{align*}
0 &= 0.003x^2+12x-12,240\\
D &= b^2-4(a)(c)\\
D &= (12)^2-4(0.003)(-12,240)\\
D &= 144+146.88=290.88
\end{align*}
$$

Because the discriminant is positive, the parabola has two real solutions. Yes, the profit of $40,000 is possible.

**Multimedia Link:** This http://sciencestage.com/v/20592/a-level-maths-:-roots-of-a-quadratic-equation-:-discriminant-:-examsolutions.html - video, presented by Science Stage, helps further explain the discriminant using the Quadratic Formula.

### 10.7 Linear, Exponential, and Quadratic Models

<article>

So far in this text you have learned how to graph three very important types of equations.

* Linear equations in slope-intercept form $y=mx+b$
* Exponential equations of the form $y=a(b)^x$
* Quadratic equations in standard form $y=ax^2+bx+c$

In real-world applications, the function that describes some physical situation is not given. Finding the function is an important part of solving problems. For example, scientific data such as observations of planetary motion are often collected as a set of measurements given in a table. One job for the scientist is to figure out which function best fits the data. In this lesson, you will learn some methods that are used to identify which function describes the relationship between the dependent and independent variables in a problem.

Using Differences to Determine the Model
----------------------------------------

By finding the differences between the dependent values, we can determine the **degree** of the model for the data.

* If the first difference is the same value, the model will be **linear.**
* If the second difference is the same value, the model will be **quadratic.**
* If the number of times the difference has been taken exceeds five, the model may be exponential or some other special equation.

![0](media/347.png "Figure 1: Example: The first difference is the same value (3). This data can be modeled using a **linear regression line.**")

The equation to represent this data is $y=3x+2$

When we look at the difference of the $y-$values, we must make sure that we examine entries for which the $x-$values increase by the same amount.

For example, examine the values in the following table.

At first glance, this function might not look linear because the difference in the $y-$values is not always the same.

![0](media/348.png "Figure 2: However, we see that the difference in $y-$values is 5 when we increase the $x-$values by 1, and it is 10 when we increase the $x-$values by 2. This means that the difference in $y-$values is always 5 when we increase the $x-$values by 1. Therefore, the function is linear.")

The equation is modeled by $y=5x+5$.

An example of a quadratic model would have the following look when taking the second difference.

![0](media/349.png "Figure 3: Using Ratios to Determine the Model")
-----------------------------------

Finding the difference involves subtracting the dependent values leading to a degree of the model. By taking the **ratio** of the values, one can obtain whether the model is exponential.

If the ratio of dependent values is the same, then the data is modeled by an **exponential** equation, as in the example below.

![0](media/350.png "Figure 4: Determine the Model Using a Graphing Calculator")
-----------------------------------------------

To enter data into your graphing calculator, find the **\[STAT\]** button. Choose **\[EDIT\].**

![0](media/351.png "Figure 5: ![0](media/352.png)")

\[Figure 6\]

* **\[L1\]** represents your independent variable, your $x$.
* **\[L2\]** represents your dependent variable, your $y$.

Enter the data into the appropriate list. Using the first set of data to illustrate yields:

![0](media/353.png "Figure 7: You already know this data is best modeled by a linear regression line. Using the **\[CALCULATE\]** menu of your calculator, find the linear regression line, **_linreg._**")

![0](media/354.png "Figure 8: ![0](media/355.png)")

\[Figure 9\]

Look at the screen above. This is where you can find the **_quadratic regression line \[QUADREG\]_**, the **_cubic regression line \[CUBICREG\]_**, and the exponential regression line, **_\[EXPREG\]._**

### 10.8 Problem-Solving Strategies: Choose a Function Model

<article>

As you learn more and more mathematical methods and skills, it is important to think about the purpose of mathematics and how it works as part of a bigger picture. Mathematics is used to solve problems that often arise from real-life situations. **Mathematical modeling** is a process by which we start with a real-life situation and arrive at a quantitative solution.

Modeling involves creating a set of mathematical equations that describes a situation, solving those equations, and using them to understand the real-life problem.

Often the model needs to be adjusted because it does not describe the situation as well as we wish.

A mathematical model can be used to gain understanding of a real-life situation by learning how the system works, which variables are important in the system, and how they are related to each other. Models can also be used to predict and forecast what a system will do in the future or for different values of a parameter. Lastly, a model can be used to estimate quantities that are difficult to evaluate exactly.

Mathematical models are like other types of models. The goal is not to produce an exact copy of the “real” object but rather to give a representation of some aspect of the real thing. The modeling process can be summarized as a flow chart:

![0](media/356.png "Figure 1: Notice that the modeling process is very similar to the problem-solving format we have been using throughout this book. One of the most difficult parts of the modeling process is determining which function best describes a situation. We often find that the function we choose is not appropriate. Then we must choose a different one.")

Consider an experiment regarding the elasticity of a spring.

Example: _A spring is stretched as you attach more weight at its bottom. The following table shows the length of the spring in inches for different weights in ounces._

$$
\begin{align*}
& \text{Weight (oz)} && 0 && 2 && 4 && 6 && 8 && 10 && 12 && 14 && 16 && 18 && 20\\
& \text{Length (in)} && 2 && 2.4 && 2.8 && 3.2 && 3.5 && 3.9 && 4.1 && 4.4 && 4.6 && 4.7 && 4.8
\end{align*}
$$

a) Find the length of the spring as a function of the weight attached to it.

b) Find the length of the spring when you attach 5 ounces.

c) Find the length of the spring when you attach 19 ounces.

Solution: Begin by graphing the data to get a visual of what the model may look like.

![0](media/357.png "Figure 2: * This data clearly does not fit a linear equation. It has a distinct curve that will not be modeled well by a straight line.")
* Nor does this graph seem to fit a parabolic shape; thus it is not modeled by a quadratic equation.
* The curve does not fit the exponential curves studied in Chapter 8.
* By taking the third set of differences, the value is approximately equal. Use the methods learned in the previous lesson to find a cubic regression equation. Check by graphing to see if this model is a good fit.

Example: _A golf ball is hit down a straight fairway. The following table shows the height of the ball with respect to time. The ball is hit at an angle of $70^\circ$ with the horizontal with a speed of 40 meters/sec_.

$$
\begin{align*}
& \text{Time (sec)} && 0 && 0.5 && 1.0 && 1.5 && 2.0 && 2.5 && 3.0 && 3.5 && 4.0 && 4.5 && 5.0 && 5.5 && 6.0 && 6.5 && 7.0\\
& \text{Height (meters)} && 0 && 17.2 && 31.5 && 42.9 && 51.6 && 57.7 && 61.2 && 62.3 && 61.0 && 57.2 && 51.0 && 42.6 && 31.9 && 19.0 && 4.1
\end{align*}
$$

a) _Find the height of the ball as a function of time._

b) _Find the height of the ball when $t=2.4 \ \text{seconds}$._

c) _Find the height of the ball when $t=6.2 \ \text{seconds}$._

![0](media/358.png "Figure 3: Solution: Begin by graphing the data to visualize the model.")

This data fits a parabolic curve quite well. We can therefore conclude the best model for this data is a quadratic equation.

To solve part a), use the graphing calculator to determine the **quadratic regression line.**

$$
y=-4.92 x^2+34.7 x+1.2
$$

b) The height of the ball when $t=2.4 \ seconds$ is:

$$
y=-4.92(2.4)^2+34.7(2.4)+1.2=56.1 \ meters
$$

c) The height of the ball when $t=6.2 \ seconds$ is

$$
y=-4.92(6.2)^2+34.7(6.2)+1.2=27.2 \ meters
$$

## 11.0 Radicals and Geometry Connections; Data Anaylsis

<article>

Radicals in mathematics are important. By using radicals as inverse operations to exponents, you can solve almost any exponential equation. Radicals such as the square root have been used for thousands of years. Square roots are extremely useful in geometry by finding the hypotenuse of a right triangle or solving for the side length of a square.

In this chapter you will learn the basics of radicals and apply these basics to geometry concepts, such as Pythagorean’s Theorem, the Distance Formula, and the Midpoint Formula. The last several sections of this chapter will discuss **data analysis**, a method used to analyze data by creating charts and graphs.

### 11.1 Graphs of Square Root Functions

<article>

You have used squared roots many times in this text: to simplify, to evaluate, and to solve. This lesson will focus on the graph of the square root function.

The square root function is defined by $f(x)=\sqrt{x-h}+k$, where $x-h\ge0$ and $(h,k)$ represents the origin of the curve.

The graph of the **parent function** $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ is shown below. The function is not defined for negative values of $x$; you cannot take the square root of a negative number and get a real value.

![0](media/360.png "Figure 1: By shifting the square root function around the coordinate plane, you will change the origin of the curve.")

Example: Graph $f(x)=\sqrt{x}+4$ and compare it to the parent function.

Solution: This graph has been shifted vertically upward four units from the parent function $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$. The graph is shown below.

![0](media/361.png "Figure 2: Graphing Square Root Functions Using a Calculator")
-------------------------------------------------

Graphing square root functions is similar to graphing linear, quadratic, or exponential functions. Use the following steps:

These figures should be side by side. Due to the captions, they have moved in a vertical alignment.

### 11.2 Radical Expressions

<article>

Radicals are the roots of values. In fact, the word _radical_ comes from the Latin word “radix,” meaning “root.” You are most comfortable with the square root symbol $\sqrt{x}$; however, there are many more radical symbols.

A **radical** is a mathematical expression involving a root by means of a radical sign.

$$
\begin{align*}
\sqrt[3]{y}=x && \text{because} \ x^3=y && \sqrt[3]{27}=3, \ because \ 3^3=27\\
\sqrt[4]{y}=x && \text{because} \ x^4=y && \sqrt[4]{16}=2 \ because \ 2^4=16\\
\sqrt[n]{y}=x && \text{because} \ x^n=y &&
\end{align*}
$$

Some roots do not have real values; in this case, they are called **undefined**.

Even roots of negative numbers are **undefined**.

$\sqrt[n]{x}$ is undefined when $n$ is an even whole number and $x<0$.

**Example 1:** _Evaluate the following radicals:_

* $\sqrt[3]{64}$
* $\sqrt[4]{-81}$

**Solution:** $\sqrt[3]{64} = 4$ because $4^3=64$

$\sqrt[4]{-81}$ _is undefined because_ $n$ _is an even whole number and_ $-81<0$.

In Chapter 8, you learned how to evaluate rational exponents:

$$
a^{\frac{x}{y}} \ where \ x=power \ and \ y=root
$$

This can be written in radical notation using the following property.

Rational Exponent Property: For integer values of $x$ and whole values of $y$:

$$
a^{\frac{x}{y}}= \sqrt[y]{a^x}
$$

Example: _Rewrite_ $x^{\frac{5}{6}}$ _using radical notation._

Solution: This is correctly read as the sixth root of $x$ to the fifth power. Writing in radical notation, $x^{\frac{5}{6}}=\sqrt[6]{x^5}$, _where_ $x^5>0$.

**Example 2:** _Evaluate_ $\sqrt[4]{4^2}$.

**Solution:** This is read, “The fourth root of four to the second power.”

$$
4^2=16
$$

The fourth root of 16 is 2; therefore,

$$
\sqrt[4]{4^2}=2
$$

In Chapter 1, Lesson 5, you learned how to simplify a square root. You can also simplify other radicals, like cube roots and fourth roots.

Example: _Simplify_ $\sqrt[3]{135}$.

Solution: Begin by finding the prime factorization of 135. This is easily done by using a factor tree.

![0](media/366.png "Figure 1: $$")
\begin{align*}
&\sqrt[3]{135}= \sqrt[3]{3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5} = \sqrt[3]{3^3} \cdot \sqrt[3]{5}\\
& 3 \sqrt[3]{5}
\end{align*}
$$

Adding or Subtracting Radicals
------------------------------

To add or subtract radicals, they must have the same root and radicand.

$$
a \sqrt[n]{x}+b\sqrt[n]{x}=(a+b)\sqrt[n]{x}
$$

**Example 3:** _Add_ $3\sqrt{5}+6\sqrt{5}$.

**Solution:** The value “$\sqrt{5}$” is considered a _like term_. Using the rule above,

$$
3 \sqrt{5}+6\sqrt{5}=(3+6) \sqrt{5}=9\sqrt{5}
$$

Example: _Simplify_ $2\sqrt[3]{13} + 6 \sqrt[3]{12}$.

Solution: The cube roots are not _like terms_, therefore there can be no further simplification.

In some cases, the radical may need to be reduced before addition/subtraction is possible.

**Example 4:** _Simplify_ $4\sqrt{3}+2\sqrt{12}$.

**Solution:** $\sqrt{12}$ _simplifies as_ $2\sqrt{3}$.

$$
\begin{align*}
4\sqrt{3}+2\sqrt{12} &\rightarrow 4\sqrt{3}+2\left ( 2\sqrt{3} \right )\\
4\sqrt{3}+4\sqrt{3}&=8\sqrt{3}
\end{align*}
$$

Multiplying or Dividing Radicals
--------------------------------

To multiply radicands, the roots must be the same.

$$
\sqrt[n]{a} \cdot \sqrt[n]{b}= \sqrt[n]{ab}
$$

Example: _Simplify_ $\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{12}$.

Solution: $\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{12}=\sqrt{36}=6$

Dividing radicals is more complicated. A radical in the denominator of a fraction is not considered simplified by mathematicians. In order to simplify the fraction, you must **rationalize the denominator.**

To **rationalize the denominator** means to remove any radical signs from the denominator of the fraction using multiplication.

**_Remember:_** 

$$
\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{a}= \sqrt{a^2}=a
$$

**Example 1:** _Simplify_ $\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$.

**Solution:** We must clear the denominator of its radical using the property above. **_Remember_**, what you do to one piece of a fraction, you must do to all pieces of the fraction.

$$
\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}=\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3^2}}=\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}
$$

Example: _Simplify_ $\frac{7}{\sqrt[3]{5}}$.

Solution: In this case, we need to make the number inside the cube root a perfect cube. We need to multiply the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt[3]{5^2}$.

$$
\frac{7}{\sqrt[3]{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt[3]{5^2}}{\sqrt[3]{5^2}}=\frac{7^3\sqrt{25}}{\sqrt[3]{5^3}}=\frac{7^3\sqrt{25}}{5}
$$

Example: _A pool is twice as long as it is wide and is surrounded by a walkway of uniform width of 1 foot. The combined area of the pool and the walkway is_ 400 square-feet. _Find the dimensions of the pool and the area of the pool._

![0](media/367.png "Figure 2: Solution:")

1.  **_Make a sketch._**
2.  **_Let_** $x=$ the width of the pool.
3.  **_Write an equation._** $Area=length \cdot width$

Combined length of pool and walkway $=2x+2$

Combined width of pool and walkway $=x+2$

$$
\text{Area}=(2x+2)(x+2)
$$

Since the combined area of pool and walkway is $400 \ ft^2$ we can write the equation.

$$
(2x+2)(x+2)=400
$$

**_4. Solve the equation:_**

$$
\begin{align*}
&& & (2x+2)(x+2)=400\\
& \text{Multiply in order to eliminate the parentheses}. && 2x^2+4x+2x+4=400\\
& \text{Collect like terms}. &&  2x^2+6x+4=400\\
& \text{Move all terms to one side of the equation}. && 2x^2+6x-396=0\\
& \text{Divide all terms by} \ 2. && x^2+3x-198=0
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
x & = \frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\
& = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2-4(1)(-198)}}{2(1)}\\
& = \frac{-3\pm \sqrt{801}}{2} \approx \frac{-3\pm 28.3}{2}
\end{align*}
$$

Use the Quadratic Formula. $x \approx 12.65$ or –15.65 feet

**_5. We can disregard the negative solution_** since it does not make sense for this context. Thus, we can check our answer of 12.65 by substituting the result in the area formula.

$$
\text{Area} = [2(12.65)+2)](12.65+2)=27.3 \cdot 14.65 \approx 400 \ ft^2.
$$

The answer checks out.

### 11.3 Radical Equations

<article>

Solving radical equations is no different from solving linear or quadratic equations. Before you can begin to solve a radical equation, you must know how to cancel the radical. To do that, you must know its **inverse**.

| **Original Operation** | **Inverse Operation** |
| --- | --- |
| **Cube Root** | Cubing (to the third power) |
| **Square Root** | Squaring (to the second power) |
| **Fourth Root** | Fourth power |
| **“$n$th” Root** | “$n$th” power |

To solve a radical equation, you apply the solving equation steps you learned in previous chapters, including the inverse operations for roots.

**Example 1:** _Solve_ $\sqrt{2x-1}=5$.

**Solution:** The first operation that must be removed is the square root. Square both sides.

$$
\begin{align*}
\left ( \sqrt{2x-1} \right )^2&=5^2\\
2x-1&=25\\
2x&=26\\
x&=13
\end{align*}
$$

Remember to check your answer by substituting it into the original problem to see if it makes sense.

Example: _Solve_ $\sqrt{x+15}=\sqrt{3x-3}$.

Solution: Begin by canceling the square roots by squaring both sides.

$$
\begin{align*}
\left ( \sqrt{x+15} \right )^2&=\left ( \sqrt{3x-3} \right )^2\\
x+15&=3x-3\\
\text{Isolate the} \ x-\text{variable}: \qquad \qquad 18 & = 2x\\
x&=9
\end{align*}
$$

Check the solution: $\sqrt{9+15}=\sqrt{3(9)-3} \rightarrow \sqrt{24}=\sqrt{24}$. The solution checks.

Extraneous Solutions
--------------------

Not every solution of a radical equation will check in the original problem. This is called an **extraneous solution**. This means you can find a solution using algebra, but it will not work when checked. This is because of the rule in Lesson 11.2.

**Even roots of negative numbers are undefined.**

Example: Solve $\sqrt{x-3}-\sqrt{x}=1$.

Solution:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Isolate one of the radical expressions}. \qquad \ \sqrt{x-3}&=\sqrt{x}+1\\
\text{Square both sides}. \quad \left ( \sqrt{x-3} \right )^2 & = \left ( \sqrt{x}+1 \right )^2\\
\text{Remove parentheses}. \qquad \quad \ x-3&=\left ( \sqrt{x} \right )^2 + 2\sqrt{x}+1\\
\text{Simplify}. \qquad \quad \ x-3&=x+2\sqrt{x}+1\\
\text{Now isolate the remaining radical}. \qquad \qquad -4&=2\sqrt{x}\\
\text{Divide all terms by} \ 2. \qquad \qquad -2 &= \sqrt{x}\\
\text{Square both sides}. \qquad \qquad \quad \ x&=4
\end{align*}
$$

Check: $\sqrt{4-3} - \sqrt{4} = \sqrt{1}-2=1-2=-1$. The solution does not check out. The equation has no real solutions. Therefore, $x=4$ is an extraneous solution.

Radical Equations in Real Life
------------------------------

Example: _A sphere has a volume of $456 \ cm^3$. If the radius of the sphere is increased by 2 cm, what is the new volume of the sphere?_

![0](media/368.png "Figure 1: **Solution:**")

1.  **Define variables.** Let $R=$ the radius of the sphere.
2.  **Find an equation.** The volume of a sphere is given by the formula: $V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

By substituting 456 for the volume variable, the equation becomes $456=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Multiply by} \ 3. \qquad \quad 1368 &= 4\pi r^3\\
\text{Divide by} \ 4\pi. \qquad 108.92&=r^3\\
\text{Take the cube root of each side.} \qquad \qquad \ r&=\sqrt[3]{108.92} \Rightarrow r = 4.776 \ cm\\
\text{The new radius is 2 centimeters more.} \qquad \qquad \ r &= 6.776 \ cm\\
\text{The new volume is}: \qquad \qquad V &= \frac{4}{3}\pi (6.776)^3 = 1302.5 \ cm^3
\end{align*}
$$

Check by substituting the values of the radii into the volume formula.

$V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3=\frac{4}{3}\pi (4.776)^3=456 \ cm^3$. The solution checks out.

### 11.4 The Pythagorean Theorem and its Converse

<article>

One of the most important theorems in history is Pythagorean’s Theorem. Simply put, it states, “The sum of the square of each leg of a right triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse.”

![0](media/369.png "Figure 1: Let’s review basic right triangle anatomy.")

The two segments forming the right angle $(90^\circ)$ are called the _legs_ of the right triangle. The segment opposite the right angle is called the _hypotenuse_.

So, the Pythagorean Theorem states, $(\text{leg}_1)^2+(\text{leg}_2)^2 = (\text{hypotenuse})^2$:

$$
a^2+b^2=c^2
$$

Or, to find the hypotenuse, $c=\sqrt{a^2+ b^2}$.

Notice this relationship is only true for **right triangles**. In later courses, you will learn how to determine relationships with non-right triangles.

Although we usually refer to the Pythagorean Theorem when determining side lengths of a right triangle, the theorem originally made a statement about areas. If we build squares on each side of a right triangle, the Pythagorean Theorem says that the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares formed by the legs of the triangle.

![0](media/370.png "Figure 2: **Multimedia Link:** For an interactive version of Pythagorean’s Theorem, use this Shockwave http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/proof/puzzle/theorem.html - applet produced by NOVA and PBS.")

The Converse of Pythagorean’s Theorem
-------------------------------------

The **Converse of the Pythagorean Theorem** is also true. That is, if the lengths of three sides of a triangle make the equation $a^2+b^2=c^2$ true, then they represent the sides of a right triangle.

With this converse, you can use the Pythagorean Theorem to prove that a triangle is a right triangle, even if you do not know any of the triangle’s angle measurements.

Example: _Does the triangle below contain a right angle?_

![0](media/371.png "Figure 3: Solution: This triangle does not have any right angle marks or measured angles, so you cannot assume you know whether the triangle is acute, right, or obtuse just by looking at it. Take a moment to analyze the side lengths and see how they are related. Two of the sides, 15 and 17, are relatively close in length. The third side, 8, is about half the length of the two longer sides.")

To see if the triangle might be right, try substituting the side lengths into the Pythagorean Theorem to see if they makes the equation true. _The hypotenuse is always the longest side,_ so 17 should be substituted for $c$. The other two values can represent $a$ and $b$ and the order is not important.

$$
\begin{align*}
a^2+b^2 & = c^2\\
8^2+15^2&=17^2\\
64+225 &= 289\\
289 & = 289
\end{align*}
$$

Since both sides of the equation are equal, these values satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem. Therefore, the triangle described in the problem is a right triangle.

Example: _One leg of a right triangle is 5 more than the other leg. The hypotenuse is one more than twice the size of the short leg. Find the dimensions of the triangle._

Solution: Let $x=$ length of the short leg. Then, $x+5=$ length of the long leg and $2x+1=$ length of the hypotenuse.

![0](media/372.png "Figure 4: The sides of the triangle must satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem.")

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{Therefore,} && x^2+(x+5)^2 = (2x+1)\\
&\text{Eliminate the parentheses.} &&  x^2+x^2+10x+25 = 4x^2+4x+1\\
&\text{Move all terms to the right hand side of the equation.} && 0 = 2x^2-6x-24\\
&\text{Divide all terms by} \ 2. &&  0 = x^2-3x-12\\
&\text{Solve using the Quadratic Formula.} && x =\frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9+48}}{2}=\frac{3 \pm \sqrt{57}}{2}\\
&&& x \approx 5.27 \ \text{or} \ x \approx -2.27
\end{align*}
$$

The negative solution does not make sense in the context of this problem. So, use $x=5.27$ and we get $\text{short}-\text{leg}=5.27, \ \text{long}-\text{leg}=10.27$ and $\text{hypotenuse} = 11.54$.

Real-World Right Triangles
--------------------------

Example: _Find the area of the shaded region in the following diagram._

![0](media/373.png "Figure 5: **Solution:**")

Draw the diagonal of the square on the figure.

![0](media/374.png "Figure 6: Notice that the diagonal of the square is also the diameter of the circle.")

Define variables. Let $c=$ diameter of the circle.

$$
\begin{align*}
&& 2^2+2^2 &= c^2\\
&& 4+4&=c^2\\
\text{Write the formula and solve}. && c^2& =8 \Rightarrow c = \sqrt{8} \Rightarrow c = 2\sqrt{2}
\end{align*}
$$

The diameter of the circle is $2\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the radius is $r=\sqrt{2}$.

Area of a circle is $A=\pi r^2 = \pi \left ( \sqrt{2} \right )^2 = 2 \pi$.

Area of the shaded region is therefore $2\pi -4 \approx 2.28$.

### 11.5 The Distance and Midpoint Formulas

<article>

You have already learned you can use the Pythagorean Theorem to understand different types of right triangles and find missing lengths. This lesson will expand its use to include finding the distance between two points on a Cartesian plane.

The Distance Formula
--------------------

Look at the points on the grid below. Find the length of the segment connecting (1, 5) and (5, 2).

![0](media/380.png "Figure 1: The question asks you to identify the length of the segment. Because the segment is not parallel to either axis, it is difficult to measure given the coordinate grid.")

However, it is possible to think of this segment as the hypotenuse of a right triangle. Draw a vertical line and a horizontal line. Find the point of intersection. This point represents the third vertex in the right triangle.

![0](media/381.png "Figure 2: You can easily count the lengths of the legs of this triangle on the grid. The vertical leg extends from (1, 2) to (1, 5), so it is $|5-2|=|3|=3 \ units$ long. The horizontal leg extends from (1, 2) to (5, 2), so it is $|5-1|=|4| = 4 \ units$ long. Use the Pythagorean Theorem with these values for the lengths of each leg to find the length of the hypotenuse.")

$$
\begin{align*}
a^2+b^2&=c^2\\
3^2+4^2&=c^2\\
9+16&=c^2\\
25&=c^2\\
\sqrt{25} & = \sqrt{c^2}\\
5 & =c
\end{align*}
$$

The segment connecting (1, 5) and (5, 2) is 5 units long.

Mathematicians have simplified this process and created a formula that uses these steps to find the distance between any two points in the coordinate plane. If you use the distance formula, you don’t have to draw the extra lines.

**Distance Formula:** Given points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the length of the segment connecting those two points is $d=\sqrt{(y_2-y_1)^2+(x_2-x_1 )^2}$

**Example 1:** _Find the distance between (–3, 5) and (4, –2)._

**Solution:** Use the Distance Formula. Let $(x_1,y_1)=(-3,5)$ and $(x_2,y_2)=(4,-2)$.

$$
\begin{align*}
d&=\sqrt{(-2-5)^2+(4-(-3))^2} \rightarrow \sqrt{(-7)^2+7^2}\\
d& =\sqrt{98}=7\sqrt{2} \ units
\end{align*}
$$

Example: _Point $A=(6, -4)$ and point $B=(2, k)$. What is the value of $k$ such that the distance between the two points is 5?_

Solution: Use the Distance Formula.

$$
d = \sqrt{(y_1-y_2)^2 + (x_1-x_2)^2} \Rightarrow 5 = \sqrt{(4-k)^2 + (6-2)^2}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Square both sides of the equation.} \qquad 5^2&= \left [ \sqrt{(4-k)^2 + (6-2)^2} \right ]^2\\
\text{Simplify}. \qquad 25 &= (-4-k)^2 + 16\\
\text{Eliminate the parentheses}. \qquad 0 & = k^2+8k+16 -9\\
\text{Simplify}. \qquad 0 & = k^2+8k+7\\
\text{Find} \ k \ \text{using the Quadratic Formula}. \qquad k&= \frac{-8\pm \sqrt{64-28}}{2}= \frac{-8\pm \sqrt{36}}{2} = \frac{-8 \pm 6}{2}
\end{align*}
$$

$k=-7$ or $k=-1$. There are two possibilities for the value of $k$. Let’s graph the points to get a visual representation of our results.

![0](media/382.png "Figure 3: Example: _At 8 a.m. one day, Amir decides to walk in a straight line on the beach. After two hours of making no turns and traveling at a steady rate, Amir was two mile east and four miles north of his starting point. How far did Amir walk and what was his walking speed?_")

![0](media/383.png "Figure 4: Solution: Plot Amir’s route on a coordinate graph. We can place his starting point at the origin $A=(0, 0)$. Then, his ending point will be at point $B=(2, 4)$. The distance can be found with the Distance Formula.")

$$
\begin{align*}
d&=\sqrt{(4-0)^2 + (2-0)^2} = \sqrt{(4)^2 + (2)^2} + \sqrt{16+4}=\sqrt{20}\\
d&=4.47 \ miles.
\end{align*}
$$

Since Amir walked 4.47 miles in 2 hours, his speed is:

$$
\text{Speed} = \frac{4.47 \ miles}{2 \ hours}= 2.24 \ mi/h
$$

The Midpoint Formula
--------------------

Consider the following situation: You live in Des Moines, Iowa and your grandparents live in Houston, Texas. You plan to visit them for the summer and your parents agree to meet your grandparents halfway to exchange you. How do you find this location?

By meeting something “halfway,” you are finding the **midpoint** of the straight line connecting the two segments. In the above situation, the midpoint would be halfway between Des Moines and Houston.

The **midpoint** between two coordinates represents the halfway point, or the **average**. It is an ordered pair $(x_m,y_m)$.

$$
(x_m,y_m)=\frac{(x_1+x_2)}{2}, \frac{(y_1+ y_2)}{2}
$$

Example: Des Moines, Iowa has the coordinates (41.59, 93.62).

Houston, Texas has the coordinates (29.76, 95.36).

Find the coordinates of the midpoint between these two cities.

Solution: Decide which ordered pair will represent $(x_1,y_1)$ and which will represent $(x_2,y_2)$.

$$
\begin{align*}
(x_1,y_1)&=(41.59,93.62)\\
(x_2,y_2)&=(29.76,95.36)
\end{align*}
$$

Compute the midpoint using the formula $(x_m,y_m)=\frac{(x_1+x_2)}{2}, \frac{(y_1+ y_2)}{2}$

$$
\begin{align*}
(x_m,y_m)&=\frac{(41.59+29.76)}{2}, \frac{(93.62+ 95.36)}{2}\\
(x_m,y_m)&=(35.675,94.49)
\end{align*}
$$

Using Google Maps, you can meet in the Ozark National Forest, halfway between the two cities.

**Example 2:** _A segment with endpoints_ (9, –2) _and_ $(x_1,y_1)$ _has a midpoint of_ (2, –6). _Find_ $(x_1, y_1)$.

**Solution:** Use the Midpoint Formula. $\frac{(x_1+x_2)}{2}=x_m$

$$
\begin{align*}
2=\frac{x_1+9}{2} \rightarrow 4&=x_1+9\\
x_1&=-5
\end{align*}
$$

Following the same $\frac{y_1+(-2)}{2}=-6 \rightarrow y_1+(-2)=-12$

$$
\begin{align*}
y_1&=-10\\
(x_1,y_1)&=(-5,-10)
\end{align*}
$$

### 11.6 Measures of Central Tendency and Dispersion

<article>

The majority of this textbook centers upon **two-variable data**, data with an input and an output. This is also known as **bivariate data**. There are many types of situations in which only one set of data is given. This data is known as **univariate data**. Unlike data you have seen before, no rule can be written relating univariate data. Instead, other methods are used to analyze the data. Three such methods are the **measures of central tendency**.

**Measures of central tendency** are the center values of a data set.

* Mean is the average of all the data. Its symbol is $\bar{x}$.
* Mode is the data value appearing most often in the data set.
* Median is the middle value of the data set, arranged in ascending order.

Example: Mrs. Kramer collected the scores from her students test and obtained the following data:

90, 76, 53, 78, 88, 80, 81, 91, 99, 68, 62, 78, 67, 82, 88, 89, 78, 72, 77, 96, 93, 88, 88

Find the mean, median, mode, and range of this data.

Solution:

* To find the mean, add all the values and divide by the number of pieces you added.

$$
mean=80.96
$$

* To find the mode, look for the value(s) repeating the most.

$$
mode=88
$$

* To find the median, organize the data from least to greatest. Then find the middle value.

53, 62, 62, 67, 68, 72, 76, 77, 78, 78, 78, 78, 80, 81, 82, 88, 88, 88, 88, 89, 90, 91, 93, 96, 99

$$
median=81
$$

* To find the range, subtract the highest value and the lowest value.

$$
range=99-53=46
$$

When a data set has two modes, it is **bimodal**.

If the data does not have a “middle value,” the **median** is the average of the two middle values. This occurs when data sets have an even number of entries.

Which Measure Is Best?
----------------------

While the mean, mode, and median represent centers of data, one is usually more beneficial than another when describing a particular data set.

For example, if the data has a wide **range**, the median is a better choice to describe the center than the mean.

* The income of a population is described using the **median**, because there are very low and very high incomes in one given region.

If the data were categorical, meaning it can be separated into different categories, the **mode** may be a better choice.

* If a sandwich shop sold ten different sandwiches, the mode would be useful to describe the favorite sandwich.

Measures of Dispersion
----------------------

In statistics, measures of **dispersion** describe how spread apart the data is from the measure of center. There are three main types of dispersion:

* Range - difference between highest and lowest values in data
* Variance
* Standard deviation

**Variance** is the mean of the squares of the distance **each data item** $(x_i)$ is from the mean.

$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{(x_1-\bar{x})^2+(x_2-\bar{x})^2+ \ldots + (x_n-\bar{x})^2}{n}
$$

The symbol for variance is $\sigma^2$.

Example: Find the variance for the following data: 11, 13, 14, 15, 19, 22, 24, 26.

Solution: First find the mean $(\bar{x})$.

$$
\bar{x}=\frac{11+13+14+15+19+22+24+26}{8}=18
$$

It’s easier to create a table of the differences and their squares.

| **$x_i$** | **$x_i-\bar{x}$** | **$(x_1-\bar{x})^2$** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **11** | –7  | 49  |
| **13** | –5  | 25  |
| **14** | –4  | 16  |
| **15** | –3  | 9   |
| **19** | 1   | 1   |
| **22** | 4   | 16  |
| **24** | 6   | 36  |
| **26** | 8   | 64  |

Compute the variance: $\frac{49+25+16+9+1+16+36+64}{8}=27$.

The variance is a measure of the dispersion and its value is lower for tightly grouped data than for widely spread data. In the example above, the variance is 27. What does it mean to say that tightly grouped data will have a low variance? You can probably already imagine that the size of the variance also depends on the size of the data itself. Below we see ways that mathematicians have tried to standardize the variance.

The Standard Deviation
----------------------

**Standard deviation** measures how closely the data clusters around the mean. It is the square root of the variance. Its symbol is $\sigma$.

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} = \sqrt{\frac{(x_1-\bar{x})^2+(x_2-\bar{x})^2+ \ldots + (x_n-\bar{x})^2}{n}}
$$

**Example 1:** Calculate the standard deviation of the previous data set.

Solution: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

$$
\sigma^2=27 \ so \ \sigma=5.196
$$

median&=\frac{110,205+111,710}{2}=\$110,957.50\\

### 11.7 Stem-and-Leaf Plots and Histograms

<article>

Understanding data is a very important mathematical ability. You must know how to use data and interpret the results to make informed decisions about politics, food, and income. This lesson will show two ways to graph data:

* as a stem-and-leaf plot and
* as a histogram

A **stem-and-leaf plot** is an organization of numerical data into categories based on place value. The stem-and-leaf plot is a graph that is similar to a histogram but it displays more information. For a stem-and-leaf plot, each number will be divided into two parts using place value.

The **stem** is the left-hand column and will contain the digits in the largest place. The right-hand column will be the **leaf** and it will contain the digits in the smallest place.

Example: In a recent study of male students at a local high school, students were asked how much money they spend socially on Prom night. The following numbers represent the amount of dollars of a random selection of 40 male students.

$$
\begin{align*}
&25 && 60 && 120 && 64 && 65 && 28 && 110 && 60\\
&70 && 34 && 35 && 70 && 58 && 100 && 55 && 95\\
&55&& 95 && 93 && 50 && 75 && 35 && 40 && 75\\
&90 && 40 && 50 && 80 && 85 && 50 && 80 && 47\\
&50 && 80 && 90 && 42 && 49 && 84 && 35 && 70
\end{align*}
$$

Represent this data in a stem-and-leaf plot.

Solution: The stems will be arranged vertically in ascending order (smallest to largest) and each leaf will be written to the right of its stem horizontally in order from least to greatest.

| **Stem** | **Leaf** |
| --- | --- |
| 2   | 5, 8 |
| 3   | 4, 5, 5, 5 |
| 4   | 0, 0, 2, 7, 9 |
| 5   | 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 8 |
| 6   | 0, 0, 4, 5 |
| 7   | 0, 0, 0, 5, 5 |
| 8   | 0, 0, 0, 4, 5 |
| 9   | 0, 0, 3, 5, 5 |
| 10  | 0   |
| 11  | 0   |
| 12  | 0   |

This stem-and-leaf plot can be interpreted very easily. By looking at stem 6, you see that 4 males spent 60 ‘some dollars’ on Prom night. By counting the number of leaves, you know that 40 males responded to the question concerning how much money they spent on prom night. The smallest and largest data values are known by looking and the first and last stem-and-leaf. The stem-and-leaf is a ‘quick look’ chart that can quickly provide information from the data. This also serves as an easy method for sorting numbers manually.

Interpreting and Creating Histograms
------------------------------------

Suppose you took a survey of 20 algebra students, asking their number of siblings. You would probably get a variety of answers. Some students would have no siblings while others would have several. The results may look like this.

1, 4, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 6

We could organize this many ways. The first way might just be to create an ordered list, relisting all numbers in order, starting with the smallest.

0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6

Another way to list the results is in a table.

| **Number of Siblings** | **Number of Matching Students** |
| --- | --- |
| 0   | 4   |
| 1   | 7   |
| 2   | 5   |
| 3   | 2   |
| 4   | 1   |
| 5   | 0   |
| 6   | 1   |

A table showing the number of times a particular category appears in a data set is a **frequency distribution**.

You could also make a visual representation of the data by making categories for the number of siblings on the $x-$axis and stacking representations of each student above the category marker. We could use crosses, stick-men or even photographs of the students to show how many students are in each category.

![0](media/384.png "Figure 1: This graph is called a **histogram**.")

A **histogram** is a bar chart that describes a frequency distribution.

The horizontal axis of the histogram is separated into equal intervals. The vertical bars represent how many items are in each interval.

![0](media/385.png "Figure 2: Example: Jim collected data at a local fair. The above histogram relates the number of children of particular ages who visited the face-painting booth. What can you conclude using this histogram?")

Solution:

* You can find the sum of the heights of each bar to determine how many children visited the face painting booth.

$$
1+3+4+5+6+7+3+1=30 \ children
$$

* The tallest bar is at age seven. There were more seven-year olds than any other age group.
* There is no bar at one or ten. This means zero ten-year-olds and zero one-year-olds had their faces painted.

Example: Studies (and logic) show that the more homework you do the better your grade in a course. In a study conducted at a local school, students in grade 10 were asked to check off what box represented the average amount of time they spent on homework each night. The following results were recorded: table on wiki... http://authors.ck12.org/wiki/index.php/Organizing_and_Displaying_Data_-_Basic

| **Time Spent on Homework (Hours)** | **Tally** | **Frequency (# of students)** |
| --- | --- | --- |

| $[0.5-1.0)$ | $\cancel{\|} \ \cancel{\|} \ \cancel{\|} \ \cancel{\|} \ \|$ | **23** |
| $[1.0-1.5)$ | $\cancel{\|} \ \cancel{\|} \ \cancel{\|} \ \cancel{\|} \ \cancel{\|} \ \cancel{\|} \ \|$ | **34** |
| $[1.5-2.0)$ | $\cancel{\|} \ \cancel{\|} \ \cancel{\|} \ \cancel{\|} \ \cancel{\|} \ \|$ | **26** |
| $[2.0-2.5)$ | $\cancel{\|}$ | **5** |
| $2.5^+$ |     | **0** |

![0](media/386.png "Figure 3: Creating Histograms Using a Graphing Calculator")
-----------------------------------------------

Drawing a histogram is quite similar to drawing a scatter plot. Instead of graphing two lists, $L_1$ and $L_2$, you will graph only one list, $L_1$.

Consider the following data: _The following unordered data represents the ages of passengers on a train carriage._

35, 42, 38, 57, 2, 24, 27, 36, 45, 60, 38, 40, 40, 44, 1, 44, 48, 84, 38, 20, 4,

2, 48, 58, 3, 20, 6, 40, 22, 26, 17, 18, 40, 51, 62, 31, 27, 48, 35, 27, 37, 58, 21.

Begin by entering the data into **\[LIST 1\]** of the **\[STAT\]** menu.

![0](media/387.png "Figure 4: Choose **$[2^{nd}]$** and $[Y=]$ to enter into the **\[STATPLOT\]** menu.")

### 11.8 Box-and-Whisker Plots

<article>

A **box-and-whisker plot** is another type of graph used to display data. It shows how the data are dispersed around a median, but it does not show specific values in the data. It does not show a distribution in as much detail as does a stem-and-leaf plot or a histogram.

A **box-and-whisker plot** is a graph based upon medians. It shows the minimum value, the lower median, the median, the upper median, and the maximum value of a data set. It is also known as a **box plot**.

This type of graph is often used when the number of data values is large or when two or more data sets are being compared.

Example: You have a summer job working at Paddy’s Pond. Your job is to measure as many salmon as possible and record the results. Here are the lengths (in inches) of the first 15 fish you found: 13, 14, 6, 9, 10, 21, 17, 15, 15, 7, 10, 13, 13, 8, 11

Solution: Since the box-and-whisker plot is based on medians, the first step is to organize the data in order from smallest to largest.

$$
6, \ 7, \ 8, \ 9, \ 10, \ 10, \ 11, \ \boxed{13}, \ 13, \ 13, \ 14, \ 15, \ 15, \ 17, \ 21
$$

Step 1: Find the median: $median=13$.

Step 2: Find the lower median.

The lower median is the median of the lower half of the data. It is also called the **lower quartile** or $Q_1$.

$$
\begin{align*}
6, \ 7, \ 8, \ & \boxed{9}, \ 10, \ 10, \ 11\\
Q_1& =9
\end{align*}
$$

Step 3: Find the upper median.

The upper median is the median of the upper half of the data. It is also called the **upper quartile** or $Q_2$.

$$
13, \ 13, \ 14, \ \boxed{15}, \ 15, \ 17, \ 21
$$

$$
Q_3=15
$$

Step 4: Draw the box plot. The numbers needed to construct a box-and-whisker plot are called the **five-number summary**.

The **five-number summary** are: the minimum value, $Q_1$, the median, $Q_2$, and the maximum value.

$$
Minimum=6; \ Q_1=9;\ median=13; \ Q_3=15; \ maximum=21
$$

![0](media/394.png "Figure 1: The three medians divide the data into four equal parts. In other words:")

* One-quarter of the data values are located between 6 and 9.
* One-quarter of the data values are located between 9 and 13.
* One-quarter of the data values are located between 13 and 15.
* One-quarter of the data values are located between 15 and 21.

From its whiskers, any outliers (unusual data values that can be either low or high) can be easily seen on a box-and-whisker plot. An outlier would create a whisker that would be very long.

![0](media/395.png "Figure 2: Each whisker contains 25% of the data and the remaining 50% of the data is contained within the box. It is easy to see the range of the values as well as how these values are distributed around the middle value. The smaller the box, the more consistent the data values are with the median of the data.")

Example: _After one month of growing, the heights of 24 parsley seed plants were measured and recorded. The measurements (in inches) are given here:_ 6, 22, 11, 25, 16, 26, 28, 37, 37, 38, 33, 40, 34, 39, 23, 11, 48, 49, 8, 26, 18, 17, 27, 14.

Construct a box-and-whisker plot to represent the data.

Solution: To begin, organize your data in ascending order. There is an even number of data values so the median will be the mean of the two middle values. $Med=\frac{26+26}{2}=26$. The median of the lower quartile is the number in the number between the 6th and 7th position, which is the average of 16 and 17, or 16.5. The median of the upper quartile is also the number between the 6th and 7th position, which is the average of 37 and 37, or 37. The smallest number is 6 and the largest number is 49.

![0](media/396.png "Figure 3: Creating Box-and-Whisker Plots Using a Graphing Calculator")
----------------------------------------------------------

The TI83 can also be used to create a box-and-whisker plot. The five-number summary values can be determined by using the trace function of the calculator.

Enter the data into $[L_1]$.

![0](media/397.png "Figure 4: Change the **\[STATPLOT\]** to a box plot instead of a histogram.")

![0](media/398.png "Figure 5: ![0](media/399.png)")

\[Figure 6\]

![0](media/400.png "Figure 7: Box-and-whisker plots are useful when comparing multiple sets of data. The graphs are plotted, one above the other, to visualize the median comparisons.")

Example: Using the data from the previous lesson, determine whether the additive improved the gas mileage.

| 540 | 550 | 555 | 570 | 570 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 580 | 585 | 587 | 588 | 590 |
| 591 | 610 | 615 | 640 | 660 |

| 500 | 589 | 618 | 619 | 629 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 633 | 635 | 637 | 638 | 639 |
| 659 | 664 | 689 | 694 | 709 |

Solution:

|     | **Regular Gasoline** | **Premium Gasoline** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Smallest # | 540 | 500 |
| $Q_1$ | 570 | 619 |
| Median | 587 | 637 |
| $Q_3$ | 610 | 664 |
| Largest # | 660 | 709 |

![0](media/401.png "Figure 8: From the above box-and-whisker plots, where the blue one represents the regular gasoline and the yellow one the premium gasoline, it is safe to say that the additive in the premium gasoline definitely increases the mileage. However, the value of 500 seems to be an outlier.")

In other words, a point that is 1.5\*IQR above Q3, or 1.5\*IQR below Q1. Based on this definition, determine which of the following would be an outlier.
    1.  January’s record-high temperature of $78^\circ$

## 12.0 Rational Equations and Functions; Statistics

<article>

The final chapter of this text introduces the concept of **rational functions,** that is, equations in which the variable appears in the denominator of a fraction. A common rational function in the **inverse variation model,** similar to the direct variation model you studied in chapter 4 lesson 6. We finish the chapter with solving rational equations and using graphical representations to display data.



</article>

### 12.1 Inverse Variation Models

<article>

In Chapter 4, Lesson 6, you learned how to write direct variation models. In direct variation, the variables changed in the same way and the graph contained the origin. But what happens when the variables change in different ways? Consider the following situation.

A group of friends rent a beach house and decide to split the cost of the rent and food. Four friends pay $170 each. Five friends pay $162 each. Six friends pay $157. If nine people were to share the expense, how much would each pay?

Let’s look at this in a table.

| **$n$ (number of friends)** | **$t$ (share of expense)** |
| --- | --- |
| **4** | 170 |
| **5** | 162 |
| **6** | 157 |
| **9** | ??? |

As the number of friends gets larger, the cost per person gets smaller. This is an example of **inverse variation.**

An **inverse variation** function has the form $f(x)=\frac{k}{x}$, where $k$ is called the constant of variation and must be a counting number and $x \neq 0$.

To show an inverse variation relationship, use either of the phrases:

* _Is inversely proportional to_
* _Varies inversely as_

**Example 1:** _Find the constant of variation of the beach house situation._

**Solution:** Use the inverse variation equation to find $k$, the constant of variation.

$$
\begin{align*}
&& y &= \frac{k}{x}\\
&& 170 &= \frac{k}{4}\\
\text{Solve for} \ k: && 170 \times 4 &= \frac{k}{4} \times 4\\
&& k &= 680
\end{align*}
$$

You can use this information to determine the amount of expense per person if nine people split the cost.

$$
\begin{align*}
y &= \frac{680}{x}\\
y &= \frac{680}{9}=75.56
\end{align*}
$$

If nine people split the expense, each would pay $75.56.

Using a graphing calculator, look at a graph of this situation.

![0](media/408.png "Figure 1: ![0](media/409.png)")

\[Figure 2\]

The graph of an inverse variation function $f(x)=\frac{k}{x}$ is a **hyperbola.** It has two branches in opposite quadrants.

If $k>0$, the branches are in quadrants I and III.

If $k<0$, the branches are in quadrants II and IV.

The graph appears to not cross the axes. In fact, this is true of any inverse variation equation of the form $y=\frac{k}{x^n}$. These lines are called **asymptotes.** Because of this, an inverse variation function has a special domain and range.

$$
\begin{align*}
Domain: \ & x \neq 0\\
Range: \ & y \neq 0
\end{align*}
$$

You will investigate these excluded values in later lessons of this chapter.

**Example 2:** **_The frequency,_** $f$, of sound varies inversely with wavelength, $\lambda$. A sound signal that has a wavelength of 34 meters has a frequency of 10 hertz. What frequency does a sound signal of 120 meters have?

**Solution:** Use the inverse variation equation to find $k$, the constant of variation.

$$
\begin{align*}
&& f &= \frac{k}{\lambda}\\
&& 10 &= \frac{k}{34}\\
\text{Solve for} \ k: && 10 \times 34 &= \frac{k}{34} \times 34\\
&& k &= 340\\
\text{Use} \ k \ \text{to answer the question:} &&\\
&& f &= \frac{340}{120}=2.83 \ hertz
\end{align*}
$$

### 12.2 Graphs of Rational Functions

<article>

In the previous lesson, you learned the basics of graphing an inverse variation function. The **hyperbola** forms two **branches** in opposite quadrants. The axes are **asymptotes** to the graph. This lesson will compare graphs of inverse variation functions. You will also learn how to graph other rational equations.

Example: Graph the function for the following values of :

Each graph is shown separately then on one coordinate plane.

As mentioned in the previous lesson, if is positive, then the branches of the hyperbola are located in quadrants I and III. If is negative, the branches are located in quadrants II and IV. Also notice how the hyperbola changes as gets larger.

Rational Functions
------------------

A **rational function** is a ratio of two polynomials (a polynomial divided by another polynomial). The formal definition is:

.

An **asymptote** is a value for which the equation or function is undefined. Asymptotes can be vertical, horizontal, or oblique. This text will focus on vertical asymptotes; other math courses will also show you how to find horizontal and oblique asymptotes. A function is undefined when the denominator of a fraction is zero. To find the asymptotes, find where the denominator of the rational function is zero. These are called **points of discontinuity** of the function.

The formal definition for asymptote is as follows.

An **asymptote** is a straight line to which, as the distance from the origin gets larger, a curve gets closer and closer but never intersects.

Example: Find the points of discontinuity and the asymptote for the function .

Solution: Find the value of for which the denominator of the rational function is zero.

The point at which is a point of discontinuity. Therefore, the asymptote has the equation .

Look at the graph of the function. There is a clear separation of the branches at the vertical line five units to the right of the origin.

![0](media/410.png)

The domain is “all real numbers except five” or symbolically written .

**Example 1:** Determine the asymptotes of .

**Solution:** Using the Zero Product Property, there are two cases for asymptotes, where each set of parentheses equals zero.

The two asymptotes for this function are and .

Check your solution by graphing the function.

The domain of the rational function above has two points of discontinuity. Therefore, its domain cannot include the numbers 2 or –3. The _domain:_ .

Horizontal Asymptotes
---------------------

Rational functions can also have horizontal asymptotes. The equation of a horizontal asymptote is , where represents the vertical shift of the rational function.

Example: Identify the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of .

Solution: The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is equal to zero.

The vertical asymptotes are and .

The rational function has been shifted down five units .

Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is .

**Multimedia Link:** For further explanation about asymptotes, read through this PowerPoint presentation presented by North Virginia Community College or watch this [CK-12 Basic Algebra: Finding Vertical Asymptotes of Rational Functions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qEOZNPce60).

Real-World Rational Functions
-----------------------------

Electrical circuits are commonplace is everyday life. For instance, they are present in all electrical appliances in your home. The figure below shows an example of a simple electrical circuit. It consists of a battery that provides a voltage (, measured in Volts), a resistor (, measured in ohms, ) that resists the flow of electricity, and an ammeter that measures the current (, measured in amperes, ) in the circuit. Your light bulb, toaster, and hairdryer are all basically simple resistors. In addition, resistors are used in an electrical circuit to control the amount of current flowing through a circuit and to regulate voltage levels. One important reason to do this is to prevent sensitive electrical components from burning out due to too much current or too high a voltage level. Resistors can be arranged in series or in parallel.

For resistors placed in a series, the total resistance is just the sum of the resistances of the individual resistors.

![0](media/411.png)

For resistors placed in parallel, the reciprocal of the total resistance is the sum of the reciprocals of the resistances of the individual resistors.

![0](media/412.png)

**Ohm’s Law** gives a relationship between current, voltage, and resistance. It states that:

![0](media/413.png)

Example: Find the value of marked in the diagram.

![0](media/414.png)

Solution: Using Ohm’s Law, , and substituting the appropriate information yields:

Using the cross multiplication of a proportion yields:

### 12.3 Division of Polynomials

<article>

We will begin with a property that is the converse of the Adding Fractions Property presented in Chapter 2.

For all real numbers $a, b$, and $c$, and $c \neq 0$, $\frac{a+b}{c}$ = $\frac{a}{c}+\frac{b}{c}$.

This property allows you to separate the numerator into its individual fractions. This property is used when dividing a polynomial by a monomial.

Example: Simplify $\frac{8x^2-4x+16}{2}$

Solution: Using the property above, separate the polynomial into its individual fractions.

$$
\begin{align*}
&& \frac{8x^2}{2}-\frac{4x}{2}+\frac{16}{2}\\
\text{Reduce.} && 4x^2-2x+8
\end{align*}
$$

**Example 1:** Simplify $\frac{-3m^2-18m+6}{9m}$.

**Solution:** Separate the trinomial into its individual fractions and reduce.

$$
\begin{align*}
& -\frac{3m^2}{9m}-\frac{18m}{9m}+\frac{6}{9m}\\
& -\frac{m}{3}-2+\frac{2}{3m}
\end{align*}
$$

Polynomials can also be divided by binomials. However, instead of separating into its individual fractions, we use a process called long division.

Example: Simplify $\frac{x^2+4x+5}{x+3}$.

Solution: When we perform division, the expression in the numerator is called the **dividend** and the expression in the denominator is called the **divisor.**

To start the division we rewrite the problem in the following form.

![0](media/418.png "Figure 1: Start by dividing the first term in the dividend by the first term in the divisor $\frac{x^2}{x}=x$. Place the answer on the line above the $x$ term.")

![0](media/419.png "Figure 2: Next, multiply the $x$ term in the answer by each of the $x+3$ terms in the divisor and place the result under the divided, matching like terms.")

![0](media/420.png "Figure 3: Now subtract $x^2+3x$ from $x^2+4x+5$. It is useful to change the signs of the terms of $x^2+3x$ to $-x^2-3x$ and add like terms vertically.")

![0](media/421.png "Figure 4: Now, bring down 5, the next term in the dividend.")

![0](media/422.png "Figure 5: Repeat the process. First divide the first term of $x+5$ by the first term of the divisor $\left(\frac{x}{x}\right)=1$. Place this answer on the line above the constant term of the dividend.")

![0](media/423.png "Figure 6: Multiply 1 by the divisor $x+3$ and write the answer below $x+5$, matching like terms.")

![0](media/424.png "Figure 7: Subtract $x+3$ from $x+5$ by changing the signs of $x+3$ to $-x-3$ and adding like terms.")

![0](media/425.png "Figure 8: Since there are no more terms from the dividend to bring down, we are done.")

The answer is $x+1$ with a remainder of 2.

### 12.4 Rational Expressions

<article>

You have gained experience working with rational functions so far this chapter. In this lesson, you will continue simplifying rational expressions by factoring.

To **simplify** a rational expression means to reduce the fraction into its lowest terms.

To do this, you will need to remember a property about multiplication.

For all real values $a, b$, and $b \neq 0, \frac{ab}{b}=a$.

Example: Simplify $\frac{4x-2}{2x^2+x-1}$.

Solution:

Both the numerator and denominator can be factored using methods learned in Chapter 9.

$$
\frac{4x-2}{2x^2+x-1} \rightarrow \frac{2(2x-1)}{(2x-1)(x+1)}
$$

The expression $(2x-1)$ appears in both the numerator and denominator and can be canceled. The expression becomes:

$$
\frac{4x-2}{2x^2+x-1}=\frac{2}{x+1}
$$

**Example 1:** Simplify $\frac{x^2-2x+1}{8x-8}$.

**Solution:** Factor both pieces of the rational expression and reduce.

$$
\begin{align*}
& \frac{x^2-2x+1}{8x-8} \rightarrow \frac{(x-1)(x-1)}{8(x-1)}\\
& \frac{x^2-2x+1}{8x-8}=\frac{x-1}{8}
\end{align*}
$$

Finding Excluded Values of Rational Expressions
-----------------------------------------------

As stated in Lesson 2 of this chapter, excluded values are also called **points of discontinuity.** These are the values that make the denominator equal to zero and are not part of the domain.

**Example 2:** Find the excluded values of $\frac{2x+1}{x^2-x-6}$.

**Solution:** Factor the denominator of the rational expression.

$$
\frac{2x+1}{x^2-x-6}=\frac{2x+1}{(x+2)(x-3)}
$$

Find the value that makes each factor equal zero.

$$
x=-2, x=3
$$

These are excluded values of the domain of the rational expression.

Real-Life Rational Expressions
------------------------------

_The gravitational force between two objects in given by the formula_ $F=\frac{G(m_1m_2)}{(d^2)}$. The gravitation constant is given by $G=6.67 \times 10^{-11} (N \cdot m^2/kg^2)$. The force of attraction between the Earth and the Moon is $F=2.0 \times 10^{20} \ N$ (with masses of $m_1=5.97 \times 10^{24} \ kg$ for the Earth and $m_2=7.36 \times 10^{22} \ kg$ for the Moon).

_What is the distance between the Earth and the Moon?_

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{Let's start with the Law of Gravitation formula}. && F =G\frac {m_1m_2}{d^2} \\
&\text{Now plug in the known values}. && 2.0\times 10^{20} N =6.67\times 10^{-11} \frac {N \cdot m^2}{kg^2}.\frac {(5.97\times 10^{24}kg)(7.36\times 10^{22}kg)}{d^2} \\
&\text{Multiply the masses together}. && 2.0\times 10^{20} N =6.67\times 10^{-11} \frac {N \cdot m^2}{kg^2}.\frac {4.39\times 10^{47}kg^2}{d^2} \\
&\text{Cancel the}\ kg^2\ \text{units}. && 2.0\times 10^{20} N = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \frac{N \cdot m^2} {\cancel{kg^2}} \cdot \frac{4.39 \times 10^{47} \cancel{kg^2}} {d^2} \\
&\text{Multiply the numbers in the numerator}. && 2.0\times 10^{20} N \frac {2.93\times 10^{37}}{d^2}N \cdot m^2 \\
&\text{Multiply both sides by}\ d^2. && 2.0\times 10^{20} N \cdot d^2 =\frac {2.93\times 10^{37}}{d^2} \cdot d^2 \cdot N \cdot m^2 \\
&\text{Cancel common factors}. && 2.0\times 10^{20} N \cdot d^{2} = \frac{2.93 \times 10^{37}} {\cancel{d^2}} \cdot \cancel{d^2} \cdot N \cdot m^2 \\
&\text{Simplify}. && 2.0\times 10^{20} N \cdot d^2 = 2.93\times 10^{37}N \cdot m^2 \\
&\text{Divide both sides by}\ 2.0 \times 10^{20} N. && d^2 =\frac {2.93 \times 10^{37}}{2.0\times 10^{20}}\frac {N \cdot m^2}{N} \\
&\text{Simplify}. && d^2 =1.465\times 10^{17} m^2 \\
&\text{Take the square root of both sides}. && d =3.84 \times 10^8m\\
\end{align*}

### 12.5 Multiplication and Division of Rational Expressions

<article>

Because a rational expression is really a fraction, two (or more) rational expressions can be combined through multiplication and/or division in the same manner as numerical fractions. A reminder of how to multiply fractions is below.

For any rational expressions $a \neq 0, b \neq 0, c \neq 0, d \neq 0$,

$$
\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d}= \frac{ac}{bd}\\
\frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d} \rightarrow \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{d}{c}=\frac{ad}{bc}
$$

Example: Multiply the following $\frac{a}{16b^8} \cdot \frac{4b^3}{5a^2}$

Solution:

$$
\frac{a}{16b^8} \cdot \frac{4b^3}{5a^2} \rightarrow \frac{4ab^3}{80a^2 b^8}
$$

Simplify exponents using methods learned in chapter 8.

$$
\frac{4ab^3}{80a^2 b^8}=\frac{1}{20ab^5}
$$

**Example 1:** Simplify $9c^2 \cdot \frac{4y^2}{21c^4}$.

**Solution:**

$$
9c^2 \cdot \frac{4y^2}{21c^4} \rightarrow \frac{9c^2}{1} \cdot \frac{4y^2}{21c^4}\\
\frac{9c^2}{1} \cdot \frac{4y^2}{21c^4}=\frac{36c^2 y^2}{21c^4}\\
\frac{36c^2 y^2}{21c^4}=\frac{12y^2}{7c^2}
$$

Multiplying Rational Expressions Involving Polynomials
------------------------------------------------------

When rational expressions become complex, it is usually easier to factor and reduce them **before** attempting to multiply the expressions.

Example: Multiply $\frac{4x+12}{3x^2} \cdot \frac{x}{x^2-9}$.

Solution: Factor all pieces of these rational expressions and reduce before multiplying.

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{4x+12}{3x^2} \cdot & \frac{x}{x^2-9} \rightarrow \frac{4(x+3)}{3x^2} \cdot \frac{x}{(x+3)(x-3)}\\
& \frac{4\cancel{(x+3)}}{3x^{\cancel{2}}} \cdot \frac{\cancel{x}}{\cancel{(x+3)}(x-3)}\\
& \frac{4}{3x} \cdot \frac{1}{x-3} \rightarrow \frac{4}{3x^2-9x}
\end{align*}
$$

**Example 1:** Multiply $\frac{12x^2-x-6}{x^2-1} \cdot \frac{x^2+7x+6}{4x^2-27x+18}$.

**Solution:** Factor all pieces, reduce, and then multiply.

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{12x^2-x-6}{x^2-1} \cdot \frac{x^2+7x+6}{4x^2-27x+18} & \rightarrow \frac{(3x+2)(4x-3)}{(x+1)(x-1)} \cdot \frac{(x+1)(x+6)}{(4x-3)(x-6)}\\
\frac{(3x+2)\cancel{(4x-3)}}{\cancel{(x+1)}(x-1)} \cdot \frac{\cancel{(x+1)}(x+6)}{\cancel{(4x-3)}(x-6)} & \rightarrow \frac{(3x+2)(x+6)}{(x-1)(x-6)}\\
\frac{12x^2-x-6}{x^2-1} \cdot \frac{x^2+7x+6}{4x^2-27x+18} &= \frac{3x^2+20x+12}{x^2-7x+6}
\end{align*}
$$

Dividing Rational Expressions Involving Polynomials
---------------------------------------------------

Division of rational expressions works in the same manner as multiplication. A reminder of how to divide fractions is below.

For any rational expressions $a \neq 0, b \neq 0, c \neq 0, d \neq 0$,

$$
\frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d} \rightarrow \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{d}{c}=\frac{ad}{bc}
$$

Example: Simplify $\frac{9x^2-4}{2x-2} \div \frac{21x^2-2x-8}{1}$.

Solution:

$$
\frac{9x^2-4}{2x-2} \div \frac{21x^2-2x-8}{1} \rightarrow \frac{9x^2-4}{2x-2} \cdot \frac{1}{21x^2-2x-8}
$$

Repeat the process for multiplying rational expressions.

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{9x^2-4}{2x-2} \cdot \frac{1}{21x^2-2x-8} & \rightarrow \frac{(3x-2)\cancel{(3x-2)}}{2(x-1)} \cdot \frac{1}{\cancel{(3x-2)}(7x+4)}\\
\frac{9x^2-4}{2x-2} \div \frac{21x^2-2x-8}{1} &= \frac{3x-2}{14x^2-6x-8}
\end{align*}
$$

Real-Life Application
---------------------

Suppose Marciel is training for a running race. Marciel’s speed (in miles per hour) of his training run each morning is given by the function $x^3-9x$, where $x$ is the number of bowls of cereal he had for breakfast $(1 \le x \le 6)$. Marciel’s training distance (in miles), if he eats $x$ bowls of cereal, is $3x^2-9x$. What is the function for Marciel’s time and how long does it take Marciel to do his training run if he eats five bowls of cereal on Tuesday morning?

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{time} &= \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}}\\
\text{time} &= \frac{3x^2-9x}{x^3-9x}=\frac{3x(x-3)}{x(x^2-9)}=\frac{3x\cancel{(x-3)}}{x(x+3)\cancel{(x-3)}}\\
\text{time} &= \frac{3}{x+3}\\
\text{If} \ x &= 5, \text{then}\\
\text{time} &= \frac{3}{5+3}=\frac{3}{8}
\end{align*}
$$

.

Marciel will run for $\frac{3}{8}$ of an hour.

### 12.6 Addition and Subtraction of Rational Expressions

<article>

Like numerical fractions, rational expressions represent a part of a whole quantity. Remember when adding or subtracting fractions, the denominators must be the same. Once the denominators are identical, the numerators are combined by adding or subtracting like terms.

**Example 1:** Simplify $\frac{4x^2-3}{x+5}+\frac{2x^2-1}{x+5}$.

**Solution:** The denominators are identical; therefore we can add the like terms of the numerator to simplify.

$$
\frac{4x^2-3}{x+5}+\frac{2x^2-1}{x+5}=\frac{6x^2-4}{x+5}
$$

Not all denominators are the same however. In the case of **unlike denominators,** common denominators must be created through multiplication by finding the **least common multiple.**

The **least common multiple (LCM)** is the smallest number that is evenly divisible by every member of the set.

What is the least common multiple of $2, 4x$, and $6x^2$? The smallest number 2, 4, and 6 can divide into evenly is six. The largest exponent of $x$ is 2. Therefore, the LCM of $2, 4x$, and $6x^2$ is $6x^2$.

**Example 2:** Find the least common multiple of $2x^2+8x+8$ _and_ $x^3-4x^2-12x$.

**Solution:** Factor the polynomials completely.

$$
\begin{align*}
2x^2+8x+8 &= 2(x^2+4x+4)=2(x+2)^2\\
x^3-4x^2-12x &= x(x^2-4x-12)=x(x-6)(x+2)
\end{align*}
$$

The LCM is found by taking each factor to the highest power that it appears in either expression. $LCM=2x(x+2)^2 (x-6)$

Use this approach to add rational expressions with unlike denominators.

Example: Add $\frac{2}{x+2}-\frac{3}{2x-5}$.

Solution: The denominators cannot be factored any further, so the LCM is just the product of the separate denominators.

$$
LCD=(x+2)(2x-5)
$$

The first fraction needs to be multiplied by the factor $(2x-5)$ and the second fraction needs to be multiplied by the factor $(x+2)$.

$$
\frac{2}{x+2} \cdot \frac{(2x-5)}{(2x-5)} - \frac{3}{2x-5} \cdot \frac{(x+2)}{(x+2)}
$$

We combine the numerators and simplify.

$$
\frac{2(2x-5)-3(x+2)}{(x+2)(2x-5)}=\frac{4x-10-3x-6}{(x+2)(2x-5)}
$$

Combine like terms in the numerator.

$$
\frac{x-16}{(x+2)(2x-5)} \text{Answer}
$$

Work Problems
-------------

These are problems where two objects work together to complete a job. Work problems often contain rational expressions. Typically we set up such problems by looking at the part of the task completed by each person or machine. The completed task is the sum of the parts of the tasks completed by each individual or each machine.

Part of task completed by first person + Part of task completed by second person = One completed task

To determine the part of the task completed by each person or machine, we use the following fact.

Part of the task completed = rate of work $\times$ time spent on the task

In general, it is very useful to set up a table where we can list all the known and unknown variables for each person or machine and then combine the parts of the task completed by each person or machine at the end.

Example: _Mary can paint a house by herself in 12 hours. John can paint a house by himself in 16 hours. How long would it take them to paint the house if they worked together?_

Solution: Let $t=$ _the time it takes Mary and John to paint the house together._

Since Mary takes 12 hours to paint the house by herself, in one hour she paints $\frac{1}{12}$ of the house.

Since John takes 16 hours to paint the house by himself, in one hour he paints $\frac{1}{16}$ of the house.

Mary and John work together for $t$ hours to paint the house together. Using the formula:

Part of the task completed = rate of work multiplied by the time spent on the task

we can write that Mary completed $\frac{t}{12}$ of the house and John completed $\frac{t}{16}$ of the house in this time and summarize the data in the following table.

| **Painter** | **Rate of work (per hour)** | **Time worked** | **Part of Task** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Mary** | $\frac{1}{12}$ | $t$ | $\frac{t}{12}$ |
| **John** | $\frac{1}{16}$ | $t$ | $\frac{t}{16}$ |

Using the formula:

Part of task completed by first person + Part of task completed by second person = One completed task

Write an equation to model the situation.

$$
\frac{t}{12}+\frac{t}{16}=1.
$$

Solve the equation by finding the least common multiple.

$$
\begin{align*}
LCM &= 48\\
48 \cdot \frac{t}{12} + 48 \cdot \frac{t}{16} &= 48 \cdot 1\\
\cancel{48}^{4} \cdot \frac{t}{\cancel{12}}+\cancel{48}^3 \cdot \frac{t}{\cancel{16}} &= 48 \cdot 1\\
4t+3t &= 48\\
7t=48 \Rightarrow t &= \frac{48}{7}=6.86 \ hours \ {Answer}
\end{align*}
$$

### 12.7 Solution of Rational Equations

<article>

You are now ready to solve rational equations! There are two main methods you will learn in this lesson to solve rational equations:

* Cross products
* Lowest common denominators

Solving a Rational Proportion
-----------------------------

When two rational expressions are equal, a **proportion** is created and can be solved using its cross products. For example, to solve $\frac{x}{5}=\frac{(x+1)}{2}$, cross multiply and the products are equal.

$$
\frac{x}{5} = \frac{(x+1)}{2} \rightarrow 2(x)=5(x+1)
$$

Solve for $x$:

$$
\begin{align*}
2(x) &= 5(x+1) \rightarrow 2x=5x+5\\
2x-5x &= 5x-5x+5\\
-3x &= 5\\
x &= -\frac{5}{3}
\end{align*}
$$

**Example 1:** Solve $\frac{2x}{x+4}=\frac{5}{x}$.

**Solution:**

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{2x}{x+4} &= \frac{5}{x} \rightarrow 2x^2=5(x+4)\\
2x^2 &= 5(x+4) \rightarrow 2x^2=5x+20\\
&2x^2-5x-20 = 0
\end{align*}
$$

Notice that this equation has a degree of two, that is, it is a _quadratic equation._ We can solve it using the quadratic formula.

$$
x=\frac{5 \pm \sqrt{185}}{4} \Rightarrow x \approx -2.15 \ \text{or} \ x \approx 4.65
$$

Solving by Clearing Denominators
--------------------------------

When a rational equation has several terms, it may not be possible to use the method of cross products. A second method to solve rational equations is to **clear the fractions** by multiplying the entire equation by the least common multiple of the denominators.

Example: _Solve_ $\frac{3}{x+2}-\frac{4}{x-5}=\frac{2}{x^2-3x-10}$.

Solution: Factor all denominators and find the least common multiple.

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{3}{x+2}- & \frac{4}{x-5}-\frac{2}{(x+2)(x-5)}\\
LCM &= (x+2)(x-5)
\end{align*}
$$

Multiply all terms in the equation by the LCM and cancel the common terms.

$$
\begin{align*}
(x+2)(x-5) \cdot \frac{3}{x+2}-(x+2)(x-5) \cdot \frac{4}{x-5} &= (x+2)(x-5) \cdot \frac{2}{(x+2)(x-5)}\\
\cancel{(x+2)}(x-5) \cdot \frac{3}{\cancel{x+2}}-(x+2) \cancel{(x-5)} \cdot \frac{4}{\cancel{x-5}} &= \cancel{(x+2)(x-5)} \cdot \frac{2}{\cancel{(x+2)(x-5)}}
\end{align*}
$$

Now solve and simplify.

$$
\begin{align*}
3(x-5)-4(x+2) &= 2\\
3x-15-4x-8 &= 2\\
x &= -25 \ \text{Answer}
\end{align*}
$$

Check your answer.

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{3}{x+2}-\frac{4}{x-5} &= \frac{3}{-25+2}-\frac{4}{-25-5}=0.003\\
\frac{2}{x^2-3x-10} &= \frac{2}{(-25)^2-3(-25)-10}=0.003
\end{align*}
$$

Example: _A group of friends decided to pool their money together and buy a birthday gift that cost $200. Later 12 of the friends decided not to participate any more. This meant that each person paid $15 more than the original share. How many people were in the group to start?_

Solution: Let $x=$ the number of friends in the original group

|     | **Number of People** | **Gift Price** | **Share Amount** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Original group | $x$ | 200 | $\frac{200}{x}$ |
| Later group | $x-12$ | 200 | $\frac{200}{x-12}$ |

Since each person’s share went up by $15 after 2 people refused to pay, we write the equation:

$$
\frac{200}{x-12}=\frac{200}{x}+15
$$

Solve by clearing the fractions. Don’t forget to check!

$$
\begin{align*}
LCM &= x(x-12)\\
x(x-12) \cdot \frac{200}{x-12} &= x(x-12) \cdot \frac{200}{x} + x(x-12) \cdot 15\\
x\cancel{(x-12)} \cdot \frac{200}{\cancel{x-12}} &= \cancel{x}(x-12) \cdot \frac{200}{\cancel{x}}+x(x-12) \cdot 15\\
200x &= 200(x-12)+15x(x-12)\\
200x &= 200x-2400+15x^2-180x\\
0 &= 15x^2-180x-2400\\
x &= 20, x=-8
\end{align*}
$$

The answer is 20 people. We discard the negative solution since it does not make sense in the context of this problem.

### 12.8 Surveys and Samples

<article>

One of the most important applications of statistics is collecting information. Statistical studies are done for many purposes:

* To find out more about animal behaviors;
* To determine which presidential candidate is favored;
* To figure out what type of chip product is most popular;
* To determine the gas consumption of cars.

In most cases except the Census, it is not possible to survey everyone in the population. So a **sample** is taken. It is essential that the sample is a **representative sample** of the population being studied. For example, if we are trying to determine the effect of a drug on teenage girls, it would make no sense to include males in our sample population, nor would it make sense to include women that are not teenagers.

The two types of sampling methods studied in this book are:

* Random Sampling
* Stratified Sampling

Random Samples
--------------

**Random sampling** is a method in which people are chosen “out of the blue.” In a true random sample, everyone in the population must have the same chance of being chosen. It is important that each person in the population has a chance of being picked.

Stratified Samples
------------------

**Stratified sampling** is a method actively seeking to poll people from many different backgrounds. The population is first divided into different categories (or **strata**) and the number of members in each category is determined.

Sample Size
-----------

In order to lessen the chance of a biased result, the sample size must be large enough. The larger the sample size is, the more precise the estimate is. However, the larger the sample size, the more expensive and time-consuming the statistical study becomes.

**Example 1:** _For a class assignment you have been asked to find if students in your school are planning to attend university after graduating high school. Students can respond with “yes,” “no,” or “undecided.” How will you choose those you wish to interview if you want your results to be reliable?_

**Solution:**

The stratified sampling method would be the best option. By randomly picking a certain number of students in each grade, you will get the most accurate results.

Biased Samples
--------------

If the sample ends up with one or more sub-groups that are either over-represented or under-represented, then we say the sample is **biased.** We would not expect the results of a **biased sample** to represent the entire population, so it is important to avoid selecting a biased sample.

Some samples may deliberately seek a biased sample in order to obtain a particular viewpoint. For example, if a group of students were trying to petition the school to allow eating candy in the classroom, they might only survey students immediately before lunchtime when students are hungry. The practice of polling only those who you believe will support your cause is sometimes referred to as **cherry picking.**

Many surveys may have a **non-response bias.** In this case, a survey that is simply handed out gains few responses when compared to the number of surveys given out. People who are either too busy or simply not interested will be excluded from the results. Non-response bias may be reduced by conducting face-to-face interviews.

**Self-selected** respondents who tend to have stronger opinions on subjects than others and are more motivated to respond may also cause bias. For this reason _phone-in_ and _online_ polls also tend to be poor representations of the overall population. Even though it appears that both sides are responding, the poll may disproportionately represent extreme viewpoints from both sides, while ignoring more moderate opinions that may, in fact, be the majority view. Self-selected polls are generally regarded as unscientific.

**Example 2:** _Determine whether the following survey is biased. Explain your reasoning._

“Asking people shopping at a farmer’s market if they think locally grown fruit and vegetables are healthier than supermarket fruits and vegetables”

**Solution:** This would be a biased sample because people shopping a farmer’s market are generally interested in buying fresher fruits and vegetables than a regular supermarket provides. The study can be improved by interviewing an equal number of people coming out of a supermarket, or by interviewing people in a more neutral environment such as the post office.

Biased Questions
----------------

Although your sample may be a good representation of the population, the way questions are worded in the survey can still provoke a biased result. There are several ways to identify biased questions.

1.  They may use polarizing language, words, and phrases that people associate with emotions.
    1.  How much of your time do you waste on TV every week?
2.  They may refer to a majority or to a supposed authority.
    1.  Would you agree with the American Heart and Lung Association that smoking is bad for your health?
3.  They may be phrased so as to suggest the person asking the question already knows the answer to be true, or to be false.
    1.  You wouldn’t want criminals free to roam the streets, would you?
4.  They may be phrased in an ambiguous way (often with double negatives), which may confuse people.
    1.  Do you disagree with people who oppose the ban on smoking in public places?

Design and Conduct a Survey
---------------------------

The method in which you design and conduct the survey is crucial to its accuracy. Surveys are a set of questions in which the sample answers. The data is compiled to form results, or findings. When designing a survey, be aware of the following recommendations.

1.  Determine the goal of your survey. What question do you want to answer?
2.  Identify the sample population. Who will you interview?
3.  Choose an interviewing method, face-to-face interview, phone interview, or self-administered paper survey or internet survey.
4.  Conduct the interview and collect the information.
5.  Analyze the results by making graphs and drawing conclusions.

Surveys can be conducted in several ways.

**Face-to-face interviews**

$\checkmark$ Fewer misunderstood questions

$\checkmark$ High response rate

$\checkmark$ Additional information can be collected from respondents

* Time-consuming
* Expensive
* Can be biased based upon the attitude or appearance of the surveyor

**Self-administered surveys**

$\checkmark$ Respondent can complete on their free time

$\checkmark$ Less expensive than face-to-face interviews

$\checkmark$ Anonymity causes more honest results

* Lower response rate

Example: _Martha wants to construct a survey that shows which sports students at her school like to play the most._

1.  _List the goal of the survey._
2.  _What population sample should she interview?_
3.  _How should she administer the survey?_
4.  _Create a data collection sheet that she can use to record her results._

Solution: The goal of the survey is to find the answer to the question: “Which sports do students at Martha’s school like to play the most?”

1.  A sample of the population would include a random sample of the student population in Martha’s school. A good strategy would be to randomly select students (using dice or a random number generator) as they walk into an all-school assembly.
2.  Face-to-face interviews are a good choice in this case since the survey consists of only one question, which can be quickly answered and recorded.
3.  In order to collect the data to this simple survey, Martha can design a data collection sheet such as the one below:

| **Sport** | **Tally** |
| --- | --- |
| baseball |     |
| basketball |     |
| football |     |
| soccer |     |
| volleyball |     |
| swimming |     |

Display, Analyze, and Interpret Survey Data
-------------------------------------------

This textbook has shown you several ways to display data. These graphs are also useful when displaying survey results. Survey data can be displayed as:

* A bar graph
* A histogram
* A pie chart
* A tally sheet
* A box-and-whisker plot
* A stem-and-leaf plot

The method in which you choose to display your data will depend upon your survey results and to whom you plan to present the data.
